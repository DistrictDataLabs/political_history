Vyou bet
p1
aVwell good i m glad you rais that and it s a critic issu i think it s not just an econom issu i think it s a moral issu i think it s frank not moral for my generat to keep spend massiv more than we take in know those burden are go to pass on to the next generat and they re go to be pay the interest and the princip all their live and the amount of debt we re ad at a trillion a year is simpli not moral
p2
aVso how do we deal with it well mathemat there are three way that you can cut a deficit one of cours is to rais tax number two is to cut spend and number three is to grow the economi becaus if more peopl work in a grow economi they re pay tax and you can get the job done that way
p3
aVthe presid would prefer rais tax i understand the problem with rais tax is that it slow down the rate of growth and you can never quit get the job done i want to lower spend and encourag econom growth at the same time
p4
aVwhat thing would i cut from spend well first of all i will elimin all program by this test if they don t pass it is the program so critic it s worth borrow money from china to pay for it and if not i ll get rid of it obamacar is on my list i apolog mr presid i use that term with all respect
p5
aVi like it
p6
aVgood okay good so i ll get rid of that i m sorri jim i m go to stop the subsidi to pbs i m go to stop other thing i like pbs i love big bird i actual like you too but i m not go to keep on spend money on thing to borrow money from china to pay for it that s number one
p7
aVnumber two i ll take program that are current good program but i think could be run more effici at the state level and send them to the state
p8
aVnumber three i ll make govern more effici we re go to cut back the number of employe combin some agenc and depart my cutback will be done through attrit by the way
p9
aVthis is the approach we have to take to get america to a balanc budget the presid said he d cut the deficit in half unfortun he doubl it trillion dollar deficit for the last 4 year the presid has put in place as much public debt almost as much debt held by the public as all prior presid combin
p10
aVwhen i walk into the oval offic i had more than a trillion dollar deficit greet me and we know where it came from two war that were paid for on a credit card two tax cut that were not paid for and a whole bunch of program that were not paid for and then a massiv econom crisi
p11
aVand despit that what we ve said is yes we had to take some initi emerg measur to make sure we didn t slip into a great depress but what we ve also said is let s make sure that we are cut out those thing that are not help us grow so 77 govern program everyth from aircraft that the air forc had order but weren t work veri well 18 govern program for educ that were well intent but weren t help kid learn
p12
aVwe went after medic fraud in medicar and medicaid veri aggress more aggress than ever befor and have save ten of billion of dollar 50 billion of wast taken out of the system and i work with democrat and republican to cut a trillion dollar out of our discretionari domest budget that s the largest cut in the discretionari domest budget sinc dwight eisenhow
p13
aVnow we all know that we ve got to do more and so i put forward a specif 4 trillion deficit reduct plan it s on a web site you can look at all the number what cut we make and what revenu we rais and the way we do it is 2 50 for everi cut we ask for a dollar of addit revenu paid for as i indic earlier by ask those of us who have done veri well in this countri to contribut a littl bit more to reduc the deficit
p14
aVgovernor romney earlier mention the bowl simpson commiss well that s how the commiss bipartisan commiss that talk about how we should move forward suggest we have to do it in a balanc way with some revenu and some spend cut and this is a major differ that governor romney and i have let me just finish this point becaus you re look for contrast
p15
aVwhen governor romney stood on a stage with other republican candid for the nomin and he was ask would you take 10 of spend cut for just 1 of revenu and he said no now if you take such an unbalanc approach then that mean you are go to be gut our invest in school and educ it mean that
p16
aVgovernor romney talk about medicaid and how we could send it back to the state but effect this mean a 30 percent cut in the primari program we help for senior who are in nurs home for kid who are with disabl and that is not a right strategi for us to move forward
p17
aVsorri
p18
aVsimpson bowl the presid should have grab that
p19
aVi have my own plan it s not the same as simpson bowl but in my view the presid should have grab it if you want to make some adjust to it take it go to congress fight for it
p20
aVthat s what we ve done made some adjust to it and we re put it forward befor congress right now a 4 trillion plan
p21
aVbut you ve been presid 4 year
p22
aVof balanc
p23
aVyou ve been presid 4 year
p24
aVright
p25
aVyou said you d cut the deficit in half it s now 4 year later we still have trillion dollar deficit the cbo say we ll have a trillion dollar deficit each of the next 4 year if you re reelect we ll get to a trillion dollar debt but you have said befor you d cut the deficit in half and this four i love this idea of 4 trillion in cut you found 4 trillion of way to reduc or to get closer to a balanc budget except we still show trillion dollar deficit everi year that doesn t get the job done
p26
aVlet me come back and say whi is that i don t want to rais tax whi don t i want to rais tax on peopl and actual you said it back in 2010 you said look i m go to extend the tax polici that we have now i m not go to rais tax on anyon becaus when the economi is grow slow like this when we re in recess you shouldn t rais tax on anyon well the economi is still grow slow as a matter of fact it s grow much more slowli now than when you made that statement and so if you believ the same thing you just don t want to rais tax on peopl
p27
aVand the realiti is it s not just wealthi peopl you mention donald trump it s not just donald trump you re tax it s all those busi that employ one quarter of the worker in america these small busi that are tax as individu you rais tax and you kill job that s whi the nation feder of independ busi said your plan will kill 700 000 job i don t want to kill job in this environ
p28
aVi ll make one more point
p29
aVokay
p30
aVthank you jim it s an honor to be here with you and i appreci the chanc to be with the presid i m pleas to be at the univers of denver i appreci their welcom and also the presidenti commiss on these debat
p31
aVwell we ve had this discuss befor
p32
aVright there has to be revenu in addit to cut now governor romney has rule out revenu he s rule out revenu
p33
aVabsolut
p34
aVlook the revenu i get is by more peopl work get higher pay pay more tax that s how we get growth and how we balanc the budget but the idea of tax peopl more put more peopl out of work you ll never get there you never balanc the budget by rais tax spain spain spend 42 percent of their total economi on govern
p35
aVwe re now spend 42 percent of our economi on govern i don t want to go down the path to spain i want to go down the path of growth that put american to work with more money come in becaus they re work
p36
aVif we re serious we ve got to take a balanc respons approach and by the way this is not just when it come to individu tax let s talk about corpor tax now i ve identifi area where we can right away make a chang that i believ would actual help the economi the oil industri get 4 billion a year in corpor welfar basic they get deduct that those small busi that governor romney refer to they don t get now doe anybodi think that exxonmobil need some extra money when they re make money everi time you go to the pump
p37
aVwhi wouldn t we want to elimin that whi wouldn t we elimin tax break for corpor jet my attitud is if you got a corpor jet you can probabl afford to pay full freight not get a special break for it
p38
aVwhen it come to corpor tax governor romney has said he want to in a revenu neutral way close loophol deduct he hasn t identifi which one they are but that therebi bring down the corpor rate well i want to do the same thing but i ve actual identifi how we can do that and part of the way to do it is to not give tax break to compani that are ship job oversea right now you can actual take a deduct for move a plant oversea i think most american would say that doesn t make sens and all that rais revenu
p39
aVand so if we take a balanc approach what that then allow us to do is also to help young peopl the way we alreadi have dure my administr make sure that they can afford to go to colleg it mean that the teacher that i met in las vega a wonder young ladi who describ to me she s got 42 kid in her class the first 2 week she s got some of them sit on the floor until final they get reassign they re use textbook that are 10 year old that is not a recip for growth that s not how america was built
p40
aVand so budget reflect choic ultim we re go to have to make some decis and if we re ask for no revenu then that mean that we ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff and the magnitud of the tax cut that you re talk about governor would end up result in sever hardship for peopl but more import would not help us grow
p41
aVas i indic befor when you talk about shift medicaid to state we re talk about potenti a 30 percent cut in medicaid over time now that may not seem like a big deal when it just is paper number on a sheet of paper but if we re talk about a famili who s got an autist kid and is depend on that medicaid that s a big problem and governor are creativ there s no doubt about it but they re not creativ enough to make up for 30 percent of revenu on someth like medicaid what end up happen is some peopl end up not get help
p42
aVjim let s we ve gone on a lot of topic there
p43
aVand so it s go to take a minut to go from medicaid to school
p44
aVgo ahead
p45
aVto oil to tax break and compani go oversea so let s go through them one by one
p46
aVfirst of all the depart of energi has said the tax break for oil compani is 2 8 billion a year and it s actual an account treatment as you know that s been in place for a hundr year now
p47
aVit s time to end it
p48
aVand in 1 year you provid 90 billion in break to the green energi world now i like green energi as well but that s about 50 year worth of what oil and gas receiv and you say exxon and mobil actual those 2 8 billion goe larg to small compani to drill oper and so forth
p49
aVbut you know if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent whi that 2 8 billion is on the tabl of cours it s on the tabl that s probabl not go to surviv if you get that rate down to 25 percent but don t forget you put 90 billion like 50 year worth of break into solar and wind to solyndra and fisker and tesla and ener1 i mean i had a friend who said you don t just pick the winner and loser you pick the loser all right so this is not the kind of polici you want to have if you want to get america energi secur
p50
aVthe second topic which is you said you get a deduct for take a plant oversea look i ve been in busi for 25 year i have no idea what you re talk about i mayb need to get a new account
p51
aVbut the idea that you get a break for ship job oversea is simpli not the case what we do have right now is a set where i d like to bring money from oversea back to this countri
p52
aVand final medicaid to state i m not quit sure where that came in except this which is i would like to take the medicaid dollar that go to state and say to a state you re go to get what you got last year plus inflat plus 1 percent and then you re go to manag your care for your poor in the way you think best
p53
aVand i rememb as a governor when this idea was float by tommi thompson the governor republican and democrat said pleas let us do that we can care for our own poor in so much better and more effect a way than have the feder govern tell us how to care for our poor
p54
aVso let state one of the magnific thing about this countri is the whole idea that state are the laboratori of democraci don t have the feder govern tell everybodi what kind of train program they have to have and what kind of medicaid they have to have let state do this and by the way if a state get in troubl well we could step in and see if we could find a way to help them
p55
aVbut the right approach is one which reli on the brillianc of our peopl and state not the feder govern
p56
aVi suspect that on social secur we ve got a somewhat similar posit social secur is structur sound it s go to have to be tweak the way it was by ronald reagan and speaker democrat speaker tip o neill but it is the basic structur is sound
p57
aVbut i want to talk about the valu behind social secur and medicar and then talk about medicar becaus that s the big driver of our deficit right now
p58
aVmy grandmoth some of you know help to rais me my grandpar did my grandfath die a while back my grandmoth die 3 day befor i was elect presid and she was fierc independ she work her way up onli had a high school educ start as a secretari end up be the vice presid of a local bank and she end up live alon by choic and the reason she could be independ was becaus of social secur and medicar
p59
aVshe had work all her life put in this money and understood that there was a basic guarante a floor under which she could not go and that s the perspect i bring when i think about what s call entitl the name itself impli some sens of depend on the part of these folk these are folk who ve work hard like my grandmoth and there are million of peopl out there who are count on this
p60
aVso my approach is to say how do we strengthen the system over the long term and in medicar what we did was we said we are go to have to bring down the cost if we re go to deal with our long term deficit but to do that let s look where some of the money is go 716 billion we were abl to save from the medicar program by no longer overpay insur compani by make sure that we weren t overpay provid and use that money we were actual abl to lower prescript drug cost for senior by an averag of 600 and we were also abl to make a signific dent in provid them the kind of prevent care that will ultim save money through the throughout the system
p61
aVso the way for us to deal with medicar in particular is to lower health care cost when it come to social secur as i said you don t need a major structur chang in order to make sure that social secur is there for the futur
p62
aVwell jim our senior depend on these program and i know ani time we talk about entitl peopl becom concern that someth is go to happen that s go to chang their life for the wors and the answer is neither the presid nor i are propos ani chang for ani current retire or near retire either to social secur or medicar so if you re 60 or around 60 or older you don t need to listen ani further
p63
aVbut for younger peopl we need to talk about what chang are go to be occur oh i just thought about one and that is in fact i was wrong when i said the presid isn t propos ani chang for current retire in fact he is on medicar on social secur he s not but on medicar for current retire he s cut 716 billion from the program now he say by not overpay hospit and provid actual just go to them and say we re go to reduc the rate you get paid across the board everybodi is go to get a lower rate that s not just go after place where there s abus that s say we re cut the rate some 15 percent of hospit and nurs home say they won t take ani more medicar patient under that scenario we also have 50 percent of doctor who say they won t take more medicar patient
p64
aVthis we have 4 million peopl on medicar advantag that will lose medicar advantag becaus of those 716 billion in cut i can t understand how you can cut medicar 716 billion for current recipi of medicar now you d point out well we re put some back we re go to give a better prescript program that s one of that s 1 for everi 15 you ve cut they re smart enough to know that s not a good trade
p65
aVi want to take that 716 billion you ve cut and put it back into medicar by the way we can includ a prescript program if we need to improv it but the idea of cut 716 billion from medicar to be abl to balanc the addit cost of obamacar is in my opinion a mistak
p66
aVand with regard to young peopl come along i ve got propos to make sure medicar and social secur are there for them without ani question
p67
aVfirst of all i think it s import for governor romney to present this plan that he say will onli affect folk in the futur and the essenc of the plan is that you would turn medicar into a voucher program it s call premium support but it s understood to be a voucher program his run mate
p68
aVi don t and let me explain whi
p69
aVagain that s for futur peopl right
p70
aVi understand
p71
aVnot for current retire
p72
aVso if you re 54 or 55 you might want to listen becaus this will affect you
p73
aVthe idea which was origin present by congressman ryan your run mate is that we would give a voucher to senior and they could go out in the privat marketplac and buy their own health insur the problem is that becaus the voucher wouldn t necessarili keep up with health care inflat it was estim that this would cost the averag senior about 6 000 a year
p74
aVnow in fair what governor romney has now said is he ll maintain tradit medicar alongsid it but there s still a problem becaus what happen is those insur compani are pretti clever at figur out who are the younger and healthier senior they recruit them leav the older sicker senior in medicar and everi health care economist who look at it say over time what will happen is the tradit medicar system will collaps and then what you ve got is folk like my grandmoth at the merci of the privat insur system precis at the time when they are most in need of decent health care
p75
aVso i don t think voucher are the right way to go and this is not my onli my opinion aarp think that the save that we obtain from medicar bolster the system lengthen the medicar trust fund by 8 year benefit were not affect at all
p76
aVwhat i support is no chang for current retire and near retire to medicar and the presid support take 716 billion out of that program
p77
aVso that s number one
p78
aVnumber two is for peopl come along that are young what i d do to make sure that we can keep medicar in place for them is to allow them either to choos the current medicar program or a privat plan their choic they get to and they ll have at least two plan that will be entir at no cost to them so they don t have to pay addit money no addit 6 000 that s not go to happen they ll have at least two plan
p79
aVand by the way if the govern can be as effici as the privat sector and offer premium that are as low as the privat sector peopl will be happi to get tradit medicar or they ll be abl to get a privat plan i know my own view is i d rather have a privat plan i d just as soon not have the govern tell me what kind of health care i get i d rather be abl to have an insur compani if i don t like them i can get rid of them and find a differ insur compani but peopl will make their own choic
p80
aVthe other thing we have to do to save medicar we have to have the benefit high for those that are low incom but for higher incom peopl we re go to have to lower some of the benefit we have to make sure this program is there for the long term
p81
aVthat s the plan that i put forward and by the way the idea came not even from paul ryan or senat wyden who is a coauthor of the bill with paul ryan in the senat but also it came from bill clinton s chief of staff this is an idea that s been around a long time which is say hey let s see if we can t get competit into the medicar world so that peopl can get the choic of differ plan at lower cost better qualiti i believ in competit
p82
aVjim if i can just respond veri quick first of all everi studi has shown that medicar has lower administr cost than privat insur doe which is whi senior are general pretti happi with it and privat insur have to make a profit noth wrong with that that s what they do and so you ve got higher administr cost plus profit on top of that and if you are go to save ani money through what governor romney is propos what has to happen is is that the money has to come from somewher
p83
aVand when you move to a voucher system you are put senior at the merci of those insur compani and over time if tradit medicar has decay or fallen apart then they re stuck and this is the reason whi aarp has said that your plan would weaken medicar substanti and that s whi they were support of the approach that we took
p84
aVone last point i want to make we do have to lower the cost of health care not just in medicar but
p85
aVbut overal
p86
aVand so
p87
aVthat s a big topic can we stay on medicar
p88
aVwell let me talk specif about what i think we need to do first we ve got to improv our educ system and we ve made enorm progress draw on idea both from democrat and republican that are alreadi start to show gain in some of the toughest to deal with school
p89
aVoh is that a separ topic
p90
aVi m sorri
p91
aVlet s get back to medicar
p92
aVlet s get back to medicar
p93
aVthe presid said that the govern can provid the servic at lower cost and without a profit
p94
aVwe ve got a program call race to the top that has prompt reform in 46 state around the countri rais standard improv how we train teacher so now i want to hire anoth hundr thousand new math and scienc teacher and creat 2 million more slot in our communiti colleg so that peopl can get train for the job that are out there right now and i want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young peopl
p95
aVif that s the case then it will alway be the best product that peopl can purchas but my experi
p96
aVmy experi is the privat sector typic is abl to provid a better product at a lower cost
p97
aVabsolut
p98
aVyes
p99
aVabsolut
p100
aVabsolut
p101
aVwhen it come to our tax code governor romney and i both agre that our corpor tax rate is too high so i want to lower it particular for manufactur take it down to 25 percent but i also want to close those loophol that are give incent for compani that are ship job oversea i want to provid tax break for compani that are invest here in the unit state
p102
aVregul is essenti you can t have a free market work if you don t have regul as a businessperson i had to have i need to know the regul i need them there you couldn t have peopl open up bank in their garag and make loan i mean you have to have regul so that you can have an economi work everi free economi has good regul at the same time regul can becom excess
p103
aVwell in some place yes
p104
aVother place no it can becom out of date and what s happen with some of the legisl that s been pass dure the presid s term you ve seen regul becom excess and it s hurt the economi
p105
aVlet me give you an exampl dodd frank was pass and it includ within it a number of provis that i think has some unintend consequ that are harm to the economi one is it design a number of bank as too big to fail and they re effect guarante by the feder govern this is the biggest kiss that s been given to new york bank i ve ever seen
p106
aVno
p107
aVthis is an enorm boon for them there have been 122 communiti and small bank have close sinc dodd frank so there s one exampl
p108
aVhere s anoth in dodd frank it say if
p109
aVon energi governor romney and i we both agre that we ve got to boost american energi product and oil and natur gas product are higher than they ve been in year but i also believ that we ve got to look at the energi sourc of the futur like wind and solar and biofuel and make those invest
p110
aVwell i would repeal the and replac it we re not go to get rid of all regul you have to have regul
p111
aVand there are some part of doddfrank that make all the sens in the world you need transpar you need to have leverag limit for institut
p112
aVbut let s mention
p113
aVlet me mention the other one let s talk the other big one the big one
p114
aVokay
p115
aVso all of this is possibl now in order for us to do it we do have to close our deficit and one of the thing i m sure we ll be discuss tonight is how do we deal with our tax code and how do we make sure that we are reduc spend in a respons way but also how do we have enough revenu to make those invest
p116
aVwell i think this is a great exampl the reason we have been in such a enorm econom crisi was prompt by reckless behavior across the board now it wasn t just on wall street you had loan offic were that were give loan and mortgag that realli shouldn t have been given becaus the folk didn t qualifi you had peopl who were borrow money to buy a hous that they couldn t afford you had credit agenc that were stamp these as a1 great invest when they weren t but you also had bank make money hand over fist churn out product that the banker themselv didn t even understand in order to make big profit but know that it made the entir system vulner
p117
aVso what did we do we step in and had the toughest reform on wall street sinc the 1930s we said you ve got bank you ve got to rais your capit requir you can t engag in some of this riski behavior that is put main street at risk we re go to make sure that you ve got to have a live will so we can know how you re go to wind thing down if you make a bad bet so we don t have other taxpay bailout
p118
aVin the meantim by the way we also made sure that all the help that we provid those bank was paid back everi singl dime with interest
p119
aVnow governor romney has said he want to repeal dodd frank and i appreci and it appear we ve got some agreement that a marketplac to work has to have some regul but in the past governor romney has said he just want to repeal dodd frank roll it back and so the question is doe anybodi out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regul of wall street becaus if you do then governor romney is your candid but that s not
p120
aVsorri jim
p121
aVwhat i believ
p122
aVbut that s just not the fact look we have to have regul on wall street that s whi i d have regul but i wouldn t design five bank as too big to fail and give them a blank check that s one of the unintend consequ of dodd frank it wasn t thought through proper we need to get rid of that provis becaus it s kill region and small bank they re get hurt
p123
aVlet me mention anoth regul in dodd frank you say we were give mortgag to peopl who weren t qualifi that s exact right it s one of the reason for the great financi calam we had and so dodd frank correct say we need to have qualifi mortgag and if you give a mortgag that s not qualifi there are big penalti except they didn t ever go on to defin what a qualifi mortgag was
p124
aVand this is where there s a differ becaus governor romney s central econom plan call for a 5 trillion tax cut on top of the extens of the bush tax cut that s anoth trillion dollar and 2 trillion in addit militari spend that the militari hasn t ask for that s 8 trillion how we pay for that reduc the deficit and make the invest that we need to make without dump those cost onto middl class american i think is one of the central question of this campaign
p125
aVit s been 2 year we don t know what a qualifi mortgag is yet
p126
aVso bank are reluct to make loan mortgag tri and get a mortgag these day it s hurt the hous market becaus dodd frank didn t anticip put in place the kind of regul you have to have it s not that dodd frank alway was wrong with too much regul sometim they didn t come out with a clear regul
p127
aVi will make sure we don t hurt the function of our marketplac and our busi becaus i want to bring back hous and get good job
p128
aVi sure do well in part it come again from my experi i was in new hampshir a woman came to me and she said look i can t afford insur for myself or my son i met a coupl in appleton wisconsin and they said we re think of drop our insur we can t afford it and the number of small busi i ve gone to that are say they re drop insur becaus they can t afford it the cost of health care is just prohibit and we ve got to deal with cost
p129
aVand unfortun when you look at obamacar the congression budget offic has said it will cost 2 500 a year more than tradit insur so it s ad to cost and as a matter of fact when the presid ran for offic he said that by this year he would have brought down the cost of insur for each famili by 2 500 a famili instead it s gone up by that amount so it s expens expens thing hurt famili so that s one reason i don t want it
p130
aVsecond reason it cut 716 billion from medicar to pay for it i want to put that money back in medicar for our senior
p131
aVnumber three it put in place an unelect board that s go to tell peopl ultim what kind of treatment they can have i don t like that idea
p132
aVfourth there was a survey done of small busi across the countri it said what s been the effect of obamacar on your hire plan and three quarter of them said it make us less like to hire peopl i just don t know how the presid could have come into offic face 23 million peopl out of work rise unemploy an econom crisi at the kitchen tabl and spend his energi and passion for 2 year fight for obamacar instead of fight for job for the american peopl it has kill job
p133
aVand the best cours for health care is to do what we did in my state craft a plan at the state level that fit the need of the state and then let s focus on get the cost down for peopl rather than rais it with a 2 500 addit premium
p134
aVwell 4 year ago when i was run for offic i was travel around and have those same convers that governor romney talk about and it wasn t just that small busi were see cost skyrocket and they couldn t get afford coverag even if they want to provid it to their employe it wasn t just that this was the biggest driver of our feder deficit our overal health care cost but it was famili who were worri about go bankrupt if they got sick million of famili all across the countri
p135
aVif they had a preexist condit they might not be abl to get coverag at all if they did have coverag insur compani might impos an arbitrari limit and so as a consequ they re pay their premium somebodi get realli sick lo and behold they don t have enough money to pay the bill becaus the insur compani say that they ve hit the limit
p136
aVso we did work on this alongsid work on job becaus this is part of make sure that middl class famili are secur in this countri and let me tell you exact what obamacar did number one if you ve got health insur it doesn t mean a govern takeov you keep your own insur you keep your own doctor but it doe say insur compani can t jerk you around they can t impos arbitrari lifetim limit they have to let you keep your kid on their insur your insur plan until you re 26 year old and it also say that you re go to have to get rebat if insur compani are spend more on administr cost and profit than they are on actual care
p137
aVnumber two if you don t have health insur we re essenti set up a group plan that allow you to benefit from group rate that are typic 18 percent lower than if you re out there tri to get insur on the individu market
p138
aVnow the last point i d make befor
p139
aVno i think i had 5 second befor you interrupt me was
p140
aVthat i admit
p141
aVwell i did with my first statement
p142
aVyou did
p143
aVbut i ll go on
p144
aVpleas elabor
p145
aVi ll elabor exact right first of all i like the way we did it in massachusett i like the fact that in my state we had republican and democrat come togeth and work togeth what you did instead was to push through a plan without a singl republican vote as a matter of fact when massachusett did someth quit extraordinari elect a republican senat to stop obamacar you push it through anyway so entir on a partisan basi instead of bring america togeth and have a discuss on this import topic you push through someth that you and nanci pelosi and harri reid thought was the best answer and drove it through
p146
aVwhat we did in a legislatur 87 percent democrat we work togeth two hundr legisl in my legislatur onli two vote against the plan by the time we were finish
p147
aVwell sure i d like to clear up the record and go through piec by piec first of all i don t have a 5 trillion tax cut i don t have a tax cut of the scale that you re talk about my view is that we ought to provid tax relief to peopl in the middl class but i m not go to reduc the share of tax paid by high incom peopl high incom peopl are do just fine in this economi they ll do fine whether you re presid or i am
p148
aVwhat were some differ we didn t rais tax you ve rais them by a trillion dollar under obamacar we didn t cut medicar of cours we don t have medicar but we didn t cut medicar by 716 billion we didn t put in place a board that can tell peopl ultim what treatment they re go to receiv we didn t also do someth that i think a number of peopl across this countri recogn which is put peopl in a posit where they re go to lose the insur they had and they want
p149
aVright now the cbo say up to 20 million peopl will lose their insur as obamacar goe into effect next year and likewis a studi by mckinsey and compani of american busi said 30 percent of them are anticip drop peopl from coverag
p150
aVso for those reason for the tax for medicar for this board and for peopl lose their insur this is whi the american peopl don t want medicar don t want obamacar it s whi republican said do not do this and the republican had a had the plan they put a plan out they put a plan a bipartisan plan it was swept asid i think someth this big this import has to be done on a bipartisan basi and we have to have a presid who can reach across the aisl and fashion import legisl with the input from both parti
p151
aVgovernor romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basi this was a bipartisan idea in fact it was a republican idea and governor romney at the begin of this debat wrote and said what we did in massachusett could be a model for the nation
p152
aVand i agre that the democrat legisl in massachusett might have given some advic to republican in congress about how to cooper but the fact of the matter is we use the same advis and they say it s the same plan
p153
aVit when governor romney talk about this board for exampl unelect board that we ve creat what this is is a group of health care expert doctor et cetera to figur out how can we reduc the cost of care in the system overal becaus there are two way of deal with our health care crisi one is to simpli leav a whole bunch of peopl uninsur and let them fend for themselv to let busi figur out how long they can continu to pay premium until final they just give up and their worker are no longer get insur and that s been the trend line or altern we can figur out how do we make the cost of care more effect and there are way of do it
p154
aVso at cleveland clinic one of the best health care system in the world they actual provid great care cheaper than averag and the reason they do is becaus they do some smart thing they say if a patient s come in let s get all the doctor togeth at onc do 1 test instead of have the patient run around with 10 test let s make sure that we re provid prevent care so we re catch the onset of someth like diabet let s pay provid on the basi of perform as oppos to on the basi of how mani procedur they ve engag in
p155
aVnow so what this board doe is basic identifi best practic and say let s use the purchas power of medicar and medicaid to help to institution all these good thing that we do
p156
aVand the fact of the matter is that when obamacar is fulli implement we re go to be in a posit to show that cost are go down and over the last 2 year health care premium have gone up it s true but they ve gone up slower than ani time in the last 50 year so we re alreadi begin to see progress in the meantim folk out there with insur you re alreadi get a rebat
p157
aVlet me make one last point governor romney say we should replac it i m just go to repeal it but we can replac it with someth but the problem is he hasn t describ what exact we d replac it with other than say we re go to leav it to the state but the fact of the matter is that some of the prescript that he s offer like let you buy insur across state line there s no indic that that somehow is go to help somebodi who has got a preexist condit be abl to final buy insur in fact it s estim that by repeal obamacar you re look at 50 million peopl lose health insur at a time when it s vital import
p158
aVthe peopl who are have a hard time right now are middl incom american under the presid s polici middl incom american have been buri they re just be crush middl incom american have seen their incom come down by 4 300 this is a tax in and of itself i ll call it the economi tax it s been crush
p159
aVwell actual it s a lengthi descript but number one preexist condit are cover under my plan number two young peopl are abl to stay on their famili plan that s alreadi offer in the privat marketplac you don t have the govern mandat that for that to occur
p160
aVbut let s come back to someth the presid and i agre on which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it s more afford for famili and then he has as a model for do that a board of peopl at the govern an unelect board appoint board who are go to decid what kind of treatment you ought to have
p161
aVno that s not
p162
aVin my opinion the govern is not effect in bring down the cost of almost anyth as a matter of fact free peopl and free enterpris tri to find way to do thing better are abl to be more effect in bring down the cost than the govern will ever be
p163
aVyour exampl of the cleveland clinic is my case in point along with sever other i could describ this is the privat market these are small these are enterpris compet with each other learn how to do better and better job
p164
aVi use to consult to busi excus me to hospit and to health care provid i was astonish at the creativ and innov that exist in the american peopl in order to bring the cost of health care down we don t need to have a board of 15 peopl tell us what kind of treatment we should have we instead need to put insur plan provid hospit doctor on target such that they have an incent as you say perform pay for do an excel job for keep cost down and that s happen intermountain healthcar doe it superbl well
p165
aVthey do
p166
aVmayo clinic is do it superbl well cleveland clinic other
p167
aVat the same time gasolin price have doubl under the presid electr rate are up food price are up health care cost have gone up by 2 500 a famili middl incom famili are be crush and so the question is how to get them go again and i ve describ it it s energi and trade the right kind of train program balanc our budget and help small busi those are the cornerston of my plan
p168
aVbut the right answer is not to have the feder govern take over health care and start mandat to the provid across america tell a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have that s the wrong way to go the privat market and individu respons alway work best
p169
aVlet me just point out first of all this board that we re talk about can t make decis about what treatment are given that s explicit prohibit in the law
p170
aVbut let s go back to what governor romney indic that under his plan he would be abl to cover peopl with preexist condit well actual governor that isn t what your plan doe what your plan doe is to duplic what s alreadi the law which say if you are out of health insur for 3 month then you can end up get continu coverag and an insur compani can t deni you if you ve if it s been under 90 day
p171
aVbut that s alreadi the law and that doesn t help the million of peopl out there with preexist condit there s a reason whi governor romney set up the plan that he did in massachusett it wasn t a govern takeov of health care it was the largest expans of privat insur but what it doe say is that insur you ve got to take everybodi now that also mean that you ve got more custom
p172
aVbut when governor romney say that he ll replac it with someth but can t detail how it will be in fact replac and the reason he set up the system he did in massachusett was becaus there isn t a better way of deal with the preexist condit problem it just remind me of he say that he s go to close deduct and loophol for his tax plan that s how it s go to be paid for but we don t know the detail he say that he s go to replac dodd frank wall street reform but we don t know exact which one he won t tell us he now say he s go to replac obamacar and assur that all the good thing that are in it are go to be in there and you don t have to worri
p173
aVand at some point i think the american peopl have to ask themselv is the reason that governor romney is keep all these plan to replac secret becaus they re too good is it becaus that somehow middl class famili are go to benefit too much from them no the reason is becaus when we reform wall street when we tackl the problem of preexist condit then these are tough problem and we ve got to make choic
p174
aVand the choic we ve made have been one that ultim are benefit middl class famili all across the countri
p175
aVno i have to respond to that
p176
aVbut the presid mention a coupl of other idea i ll just note first educ i agre educ is key particular the futur of our economi but our train program right now we ve got 47 of them hous in the feder govern report to 8 differ agenc overhead is overwhelm we ve got to get those dollar back to the state and go to the worker so they can creat their own pathway to get in the train they need for job that will realli help them
p177
aVwhich is my experi as a governor is if i come in and lay down a piec of legisl and say it s my way or the highway i don t get a lot done what i do is the same way that tip o neill and ronald reagan work togeth some year ago when ronald reagan ran for offic he laid out the principl that he was go to foster he said he was go to lower tax rate he said he was go to broaden the base you ve said the same thing you re go to simplifi the tax code broaden the base
p178
aVthose are my principl i want to bring down the tax burden on middl incom famili and i m go to work togeth with congress to say okay what are the various way we can bring down deduct for instanc one way for instanc would be to have a singl number make up a number 25 000 50 000 anybodi could have deduct up to that amount and then that number disappear for high incom peopl that s one way one could do it
p179
aVone could follow bowl simpson as a model and take deduct by deduct and make differ that way there are altern to accomplish the object i have which is to bring down rate broaden the base simplifi the code and creat incent for growth
p180
aVand with regard to health care you had remark detail with regard to my preexist condit plan you obvious have studi up on my plan in fact i do have a plan that deal with peopl with preexist condit that s part of my health care plan and what we did in massachusett is a model for the nation state by state and i said that at that time the feder govern take over health care for the entir nation and whisk asid the 10th amend which give state the right for these kind of thing is not the cours for america to have a stronger more vibrant economi
p181
aVwell i definit think there are differ the first role of the feder govern is to keep the american peopl safe that s it most basic function and as command in chief that is someth that i have work on and thought about everi singl day that i ve been in the oval offic
p182
aVthe second area taxat we agre we ought to bring the tax rate down and i do both for corpor and for individu but in order for us not to lose revenu and have the govern run out of money i also lower deduct and credit and exempt so that we keep take in the same money when you also account for growth
p183
aVbut i also believ that govern has the capac the feder govern has the capac to help open up opportun and creat ladder of opportun and to creat framework where the american peopl can succeed look the genius of america is the free enterpris system and freedom and the fact that peopl can go out there and start a busi work on an idea make their own decis but as abraham lincoln understood there are also some thing we do better togeth
p184
aVso in the middl of the civil war abraham lincoln said let s help to financ the transcontinent railroad let s start the nation academi of scienc let s start land grant colleg becaus we want to give these gateway of opportun for all american becaus if all american are get opportun we re all go to be better off that doesn t restrict peopl s freedom that enhanc it
p185
aVand so what i ve tri to do as presid is to appli those same principl when it come to educ what i ve said is we ve got to reform school that are not work we use someth call race to the top it wasn t a top down approach governor what we ve said is to state we ll give you more money if you initi reform and as a consequ you have 46 state around the countri who have made a real differ
p186
aVbut what i ve also said is let s hire anoth 100 000 math and scienc teacher to make sure we maintain our technolog lead and our peopl are skill and abl to succeed and hard press state right now can t all do that in fact we ve seen layoff of hundr of thousand of teacher over the last sever year and governor romney doesn t think we need more teacher
p187
aVi do becaus i think that that is the kind of invest where the feder govern can help it can t do it all but it can make a differ and as a consequ we ll have a better train workforc and that will creat job becaus compani want to locat in place where we ve got a skill workforc
p188
aVwell first i love great school massachusett our school are rank number 1 of all 50 state and the key to great school great teacher so i reject the idea that i don t believ in great teacher or more teacher everi school district everi state should make that decis on their own
p189
aVthe role of govern look behind us the constitut and the declar of independ the role of govern is to promot and protect the principl of those document first life and liberti we have a respons to protect the live and liberti of our peopl and that mean a militari second to none i do not believ in cut our militari i believ in maintain the strength of america s militari
p190
aVsecond in that line that say we are endow by our creator with our right i believ we must maintain our commit to religi toler and freedom in this countri that statement also say that we are endow by our creator with the right to pursu happi as we choos i interpret that as one make sure that those peopl who are less fortun and can t care for themselv are care by by one anoth we re a nation that believ that we are all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulti those that are elder and have problem and challeng those that are disabl we care for them and we look for discoveri and innov all these thing desir out of the american heart to provid the pursuit of happi for our citizen
p191
aVbut we also believ in maintain for individu the right to pursu their dream and not to have the govern substitut itself for the right of free individu and what we re see right now is in my view a trickl down govern approach which has govern think it can do a better job than free peopl pursu their dream and it s not work
p192
aVthe third area energi energi is critic and the presid point out correct that product of oil and gas in the u s is up but not due to his polici in spite of his polici mr presid all of the increas in natur gas and oil has happen on privat land not on govern land on govern land your administr has cut the number of permit and licens in half
p193
aVand the proof of that is 23 million peopl out of work the proof of that is one out of six peopl in poverti the proof of that is we ve gone from 32 million on food stamp to 47 million on food stamp the proof of that is that 50 percent of colleg graduat this year can t find work we know that the path we re take is not work it s time for a new path
p194
aVwell the primari respons for educ is of cours at the state and local level but the feder govern also can play a veri import role and i agre with secretari arn duncan he s some idea he s put forward on race to the top not all of them but some of them i agre with and congratul him for pursu that the feder govern can get local and state school to do a better job
p195
aVmy own view by the way is i ve ad to that i happen to believ i want the kid that are get feder dollar from idea or titl i these are disabl kid or poor kid or lower incom kid rather i want them to be abl to go to the school of their choic so all feder fund instead of go to the state or to the school district i d have go if you will follow the child and let the parent and the child decid where to send their student
p196
aVwell as i ve indic i think that it has a signific role to play through our race to the top program we ve work with republican and democrat governor to initi major reform and they re have an impact right now
p197
aVthis is where budget matter becaus budget reflect choic so when governor romney indic that he want to cut tax and potenti benefit folk like me and him and to pay for it we re have to initi signific cut in feder support for educ that make a differ
p198
aVhis run mate congressman ryan put forward a budget that reflect mani of the principl that governor romney s talk about and it wasn t veri detail this seem to be a trend but what it did do is to if you extrapol how much money we re talk about you d look at cut the educ budget by up to 20 percent
p199
aVif i m presid i ll doubl them and also get the oil from offshor in alaska and i ll bring that pipelin in from canada and by the way i like coal i m go to make sure we can continu to burn clean coal peopl in the coal industri feel like it s get crush by your polici i want to get america and north america energi independ so we can creat those job
p200
aVwhen it come to communiti colleg we are see great work done out there all over the countri becaus we have the opportun to train peopl for job that exist right now and one of the thing i suspect governor romney and i probabl agre on is get busi to work with communiti colleg so that they re set up their train program
p201
aVlet me just finish the point
p202
aVoh sure oh yes it s by the way go veri well in my state by the way yes
p203
aVi suspect it will be a small agreement the where they re partner so that they re design train program and peopl who are go through them know that there s a job wait for them if they complet it
p204
aVthat make a big differ but that requir some feder support
p205
aVlet me just use say one final exampl when it come to make colleg afford whether it s 2 year or 4 year one of the thing that i did as presid was we were send 60 billion to bank and lender as middlemen for the student loan program even though the loan were guarante so there was no risk for the bank or the lender but they were take billion out of the system and we said whi not cut out the middleman and as a consequ what we ve been abl to do is to provid million more student assist lower or keep low interest rate on student loan
p206
aVand this is an exampl of where our prioriti make a differ governor romney i genuin believ care about educ but when he tell a student that you should borrow money from your parent to go to colleg that indic the degre to which there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folk like myself folk like michell kid probabl who attend univers of denver just don t have that option and for us to be abl to make sure that they ve got that opportun and they can walk through that door that is vital import not just to those kid it s how we re go to grow this economi over the long term
p207
aVand final with regard to that tax cut look i m not look to cut massiv tax and to reduc the revenu go to the govern my number one principl is there will be no tax cut that add to the deficit i want to underlin that no tax cut that add to the deficit but i do want to reduc the burden paid be paid by middl incom american and to do that that also mean i cannot reduc the burden paid by high incom american so ani languag to the contrari is simpli not accur
p208
aVjim jim
p209
aVyes he has a chanc
p210
aVmr presid you re entitl as the presid to your own airplan and to your own hous but not to your own fact
p211
aVbut you make a veri good point which is that the place you put your money make a pretti clear indic of where your heart is you put 90 billion into green job and i look i m all in favor of green energi nineti billion that would have hire 2 million teacher nineti billion dollar and these busi mani of them have gone out of busi i think about half of them of the one that have been invest in have gone out of busi a number of them happen to be own by peopl who were contributor to your campaign
p212
aVlook the right cours for america s govern we were talk about the role of govern is not to becom the econom player pick winner and loser tell peopl what kind of health treatment they can receiv take over the health care system that has exist in this countri for a long long time and has produc the best health record in the world the right answer for govern is to say how do we make the privat sector becom more effici and more effect how do we get school to be more competit
p213
aVlet s grade them i propos we grade our school so parent know which school are succeed and fail so they can take their child to a school that s be more success i don t want to cut our commit to educ i want to make it more effect and effici
p214
aVand by the way i ve had that experi i don t just talk about it i ve been there massachusett school are rank number one in the nation this is not becaus i didn t have commit to educ it s becaus i care about educ for all of our kid
p215
aVjim i
p216
aVlook
p217
aVyou ve done a great job jim
p218
aVjim i had the great experi it didn t seem like it at the time of be elect in a state where my legislatur was 87 percent democrat and that meant i figur out from day one i had to get along and i had to work across the aisl to get anyth done we drove our school to be number one in the nation we cut tax 19 time
p219
aVas presid i will sit down on day one actual the day after i get elect i ll sit down with leader the democrat leader as well as republican leader and continu as we did in my state we met everi monday for a coupl hour talk about the issu and the challeng in our state in that case we have to work on a collabor basi not becaus we re go to compromis our principl but becaus there s common ground
p220
aVand the challeng america face right now look the reason i m in this race is there are peopl that are realli hurt today in this countri and we face this deficit could crush the futur generat what s happen in the middl east there are develop around the world that are of real concern and republican and democrat both love america but we need to have leadership leadership in washington that will actual bring peopl togeth and get the job done and could not care less if it s a republican or a democrat i ve done it befor i ll do it again
p221
aVwell first of all i think governor romney is go to have a busi first day becaus he s also go to repeal obamacar which will not be veri popular among democrat as you re sit down with them
p222
aVbut look my philosophi has been i will take idea from everybodi democrat or republican as long as they re advanc the caus of make middl class famili stronger and give ladder of opportun to the middl class that s how we cut tax for middl class famili and small busi that s how we cut a trillion dollar of spend that wasn t advanc that caus that s how we sign three trade deal into law that are help us to doubl our export and sell more american product around the world
p223
aVthat s how we repeal don t ask don t tell that s how we end the war in iraq as i promis and that s how we re go to wind down the war in afghanistan that s how we went after al qaida and bin laden
p224
aVso we ve seen progress even under republican control of the hous of repres but ultim part of be principl part of be a leader is a be abl to describ exact what it is that you intend to do not just say i ll sit down but you have to have a plan number two what s import is occasion you ve got to say no to folk both in your own parti and in the other parti
p225
aVand yes we had some fight between me and the republican when they fought back against us rein in the excess of wall street absolut becaus that was a fight that need to be had when we were fight about whether or not we were go to make sure that american had more secur with their health insur and they said no yes that was a fight that we need to have
p226
aVand so part of leadership and govern is both say what it is that you are for but also be will to say no to some thing and i ve got to tell you governor romney when it come to his own parti dure the cours of this campaign has not display that willing to say no to some of the more extrem part of his parti
p227
aVwell i think let s talk about tax becaus i think it s instruct now 4 year ago when i stood on this stage i said that i would cut tax for middl class famili and that s exact what i did we cut tax for middl class famili by about 3 600
p228
aVwell jim i want to thank you and i want to thank governor romney becaus i think this was a terrif debat and i veri much appreci it and i want to thank the univers of denver
p229
aVfour year ago we were go through a major crisi and yet my faith and confid in the american futur is undiminish and the reason is becaus of it peopl becaus of the woman i met in north carolina who decid at 55 to go back to school becaus she want to inspir her daughter and now has a job from that new train that she s gotten becaus of a compani in minnesota who was will to give up salari and perk for their execut to make sure that they didn t lay off worker dure a recess the autowork that you meet in toledo or detroit take such pride in build the best car in the world not just becaus of a paycheck but becaus it give them that sens of pride that they re help to build america
p230
aVand so the question now is how do we build on those strength and everyth that i ve tri to do and everyth that i m now propos for the next 4 year in term of improv our educ system or develop american energi or make sure that we re close loophol for compani that are ship job oversea and focus on small busi and compani that are creat job here in the unit state or close our deficit in a respons balanc way that allow us to invest in our futur all those thing are design to make sure that the american peopl their genius their grit their determin is channel and they have an opportun to succeed and everybodi s get a fair shot and everybodi s get a fair share everybodi s do a fair share and everybodi s play by the same rule
p231
aVthank you jim and mr presid and thank you for tune in this even
p232
aVthis is a this is an import elect and i m concern about america i m concern about the direct america has been take over the last 4 year i know this is bigger than an elect about the two of us as individu it s bigger than our respect parti it s an elect about the cours of america what kind of america do you want to have for yourself and for your children
p233
aVand there realli are two veri differ path that we began speak about this even and over the cours of this month we re go to have two more presidenti debat and a vice presidenti debat we ll talk about those path but they lead in veri differ direct and it s not just look to our word that you have to take into evid of where they go you can look at the record
p234
aVthere s no question in my mind that if the presid were to be reelect you ll continu to a see a middl class squeez with incom go down and price go up i ll get incom up again you ll see chronic unemploy we ve had 43 straight month with unemploy abov 8 percent if i m presid i will creat help creat 12 million new job in this countri with rise incom
p235
aVand the reason is becaus i believ that we do best when the middl class is do well and by give them those tax cut they had a littl more money in their pocket and so mayb they can buy a new car they are certain in a better posit to weather the extraordinari recess that we went through they can buy a comput for their kid who is go off to colleg which mean they re spend more money busi have more custom busi make more profit and then hire more worker
p236
aVif the presid s reelect obamacar will be fulli instal in my view that s go to mean a whole differ way of life for peopl who count on the insur plan they had in the past mani will lose it you re go to see health premium go up by some 2 500 per famili if i m elect we won t have obamacar we ll put in place the kind of principl that i put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own program to get peopl insur and we ll focus on get the cost of health care down
p237
aVif the presid were to be reelect you re go to see a 716 billion cut to medicar you ll have 4 million peopl who will lose medicar advantag you ll have hospit and provid that will no longer accept medicar patient i ll restor that 716 billion to medicar
p238
aVand final militari if the presid s reelect you ll see dramat cut to our militari the secretari of defens has said these would be even devast i will not cut our commit to our militari i will keep america strong and get america s middl class work again
p239
aVthank you jim

aVnow governor romney s propos that he has been promot for 18 month call for a 5 trillion tax cut on top of 2 trillion of addit spend for our militari and he is say that he is go to pay for it by close loophol and deduct the problem is that he s been ask over a hundr time how you would close those deduct and loophol and he hasn t been abl to identifi them
p241
aVbut i m go to make an import point here jim when you add up all the loophol and deduct that upper incom individu can are current take advantag of you take those all away you don t come close to pay for 5 trillion in tax cut and 2 trillion in addit militari spend
p242
aVand that s whi independ studi look at this said the onli way to meet governor romney s pledg of not reduc the deficit or not ad to the deficit is by burden middl class famili the averag middl class famili with children would pay about 2 000 more
p243
aVnow that s not my analysi that s the analysi of economist who have look at this and that kind of top down econom where folk at the top are do well so the averag person make 3 million buck is get a 250 000 tax break while middl class famili are burden further that s not what i believ is a recip for econom growth
p244
aVbut i get right right
p245
aVyes well but virtual
p246
aVvirtual everyth he just said about my tax plan is inaccur
p247
aVso if the tax plan he describ were a tax plan i was ask to support i d say absolut not i m not look for a 5 trillion tax cut what i ve said is i won t put in place a tax cut that add to the deficit that s part one so there s no economist can say mitt romney s tax plan add 5 trillion if i say i will not add to the deficit with my tax plan
p248
aVwell for 18 month he s been run on this tax plan and now 5 week befor the elect he s say that his big bold idea is never mind and the fact is that if you are lower the rate the way you describ governor then it is not possibl to come up with enough deduct and loophol that onli affect high incom individu to avoid either rais the deficit or burden the middl class it s math it s arithmet
p249
aVnow governor romney and i do share a deep interest in encourag small busi growth so at the same time that my tax plan has alreadi lower tax for 98 percent of famili i also lower tax for small busi 18 time and what i want to do is continu the tax rate the tax cut that we put into place for small busi and famili
p250
aVbut i have said that for incom over 250 000 a year that we should go back to the rate that we had when bill clinton was presid when we creat 23 million new job went from deficit to surplus and creat a whole lot of millionair to boot and the reason this is import is becaus by do that we can not onli reduc the deficit we can not onli encourag job growth through small busi but we re also abl to make the invest that are necessari in educ or in energi
p251
aVand we do have a differ though when it come to definit of small busi under my plan 97 percent of small busi would not see their incom tax go up governor romney say well those top 3 percent they re the job creator they d be burden but under governor romney s definit there are a whole bunch of millionair and billionair who are small busi donald trump is a small busi and i know donald trump doesn t like to think of himself as small anyth but that s how you defin small busi if you re get busi incom
p252
aVand that kind of approach i believ will not grow our economi becaus the onli way to pay for it without either burden the middl class or blow up our deficit is to make drastic cut in thing like educ make sure that we are continu to invest in basic scienc and research all the thing that are help america grow and i think that would be a mistak
p253
aVjim let me just come back on that point which is these
p254
aVwell thank you veri much jim for this opportun i want to thank governor romney and the univers of denver for your hospit
p255
aVsmall busi we re talk about
p256
aVit s fun isn t it
p257
aVthat s okay
p258
aVthat s good
p259
aVyou bet presid you re mr presid you re absolut right which is that with regard to 97 percent of the busi are not tax at the 35 percent tax rate they re tax at a lower rate but those busi that are in the last 3 percent of busi happen to employ half half of all the peopl who work in small busi those are the busi that employ one quarter of all the worker in america and your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent
p260
aVnow i talk to a guy who has a veri small busi he s in the electron busi in st loui he has four employe he said he and his son calcul how much they pay in tax feder incom tax feder payrol tax state incom tax state sale tax state properti tax gasolin tax it ad up to well over 50 percent of what they earn and your plan is to take the tax rate on success small busi from 35 percent to 40 percent the nation feder of independ busi has said that will cost 700 000 job
p261
aVi don t want to cost job my prioriti is job and so what i do is i bring down the tax rate lower deduct and exempt the same idea behind bowl simpson by the way get the rate down lower deduct and exempt to creat more job becaus there s noth better for get us to a balanc budget than have more peopl work earn more money pay more tax that s by far the most effect and effici way to get this budget balanc
p262
aVjim i you may want to move on to anoth topic but i would just say this to the american peopl if you believ that we can cut tax by 5 trillion and add 2 trillion in addit spend that the militari is not ask for 7 trillion just to give you a sens over 10 year that s more than our entir defens budget and you think that by close loophol and deduct for the well to do somehow you will not end up pick up the tab then governor romney s plan may work for you
p263
aVbut i think math common sens and our histori show us that s not a recip for job growth look we ve tri this we ve tri both approach the approach that governor romney is talk about is the same sale pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003 and we end up with the slowest job growth in 50 year we end up move from surplus to deficit and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress
p264
aVbill clinton tri the approach that i m talk about we creat 23 million new job we went from deficit to surplus and busi did veri well so in some way we ve got some data on which approach is more like to creat job and opportun for american and i believ that the economi work best when middl class famili are get tax break so that they ve got some money in their pocket and those of us who have done extraordinarili well becaus of this magnific countri that we live in that we can afford to do a littl bit more to make sure we re not blow up the deficit
p265
aVjim the presid began this segment so i think i get the last word so i m go to take it
p266
aVwell but he get the first word of that segment i get the last word of that segment well i hope let me just make this comment
p267
aVhe can have them he can have them go ahead
p268
aVgo ahead
p269
aVlet me repeat what i said
p270
aVall right
p271
aVi m not in favor of a 5 trillion tax cut that s not my plan my plan is not to put in place ani tax cut that will add to the deficit that s point one so you may keep refer to it as a 5 trillion tax cut but that s not my plan
p272
aVokay
p273
aVnumber two let s look at histori my plan is not like anyth that s been tri befor my plan is to bring down rate but also bring down deduct and exempt and credit at the same time so the revenu stay in but that we bring down rate to get more peopl work my prioriti is put peopl back to work in america they re suffer in this countri
p274
aVand we talk about evid look at the evid of the last 4 year it s absolut extraordinari we ve got 23 million peopl out of work or stop look for work in this countri
p275
aVit s just we ve got when the presid took offic 32 million peopl on food stamp 47 million on food stamp today econom growth this year slower than last year and last year slower than the year befor go forward with the status quo is not go to cut it for the american peopl who are struggl today
p276
aVwhen it came to osama bin laden the presid the first day in offic i was sit with him in the oval offic he call in the cia and sign an order say my highest prioriti is to get bin laden
p277
aVthey are not four year closer to a nuclear weapon
p278
aVof cours they are
p279
aVthey re they re closer to be abl to get enough fissil materi to put in a weapon if they had a weapon
p280
aVoh i didn t say no i m not say that but fact matter martha you re a foreign polici expert fact matter all this loos talk about them all they have to do is get to enrich uranium in a certain amount and they have a weapon not true not true
p281
aVthey are more and if we ever have to take action unlik when we took offic we will have the world behind us and that matter that matter
p282
aVhe is right it could prove catastroph if we didn t do it with precis
p283
aVprior to the elect prior to the him be sworn in governor romney was ask the question about how he would proceed he said i wouldn t move heaven and earth to get bin laden he didn t understand it was more than about take a murder off the battlefield it was about restor america s heart and let terrorist around the world know if you do harm to america we will track you to the gate of hell if need be
p284
aVand what it doe is it undermin our credibl by back up the point when we make it that all option are on the tabl that s the point the ayatollah see these kind of statement and they think i m go to get a nuclear weapon
p285
aVwhen when we see the kind of equivoc that took place becaus this administr want a precondit polici so when the green revolut start up they were silent for nine day when they see us put when they see us put daylight between ourselv and our alli in israel that give them encourag when they see russia water down ani further sanction the onli reason we got a u n sanction is becaus russia water it down and prevent these central bank sanction in the first place so when they see this kind of activ they are encourag to continu and that s the problem
p286
aVmartha let me tell you what russia
p287
aVi ll tell you what s wors i ll tell you what s wors
p288
aVa nuclear arm iran which trigger a nuclear arm race in the middl east this is the world s largest sponsor of of terror they ve dedic themselv
p289
aVwe can t live with that
p290
aVwar should alway be the absolut last resort that s whi these crippl sanction which bibi netanyahu say we should continu which if i m not mistaken governor romney say we we should continu i may be mistaken he chang his mind so often i could be wrong
p291
aVand last the presid of the unit state has has led with a steadi hand and clear vision governor romney the opposit the last thing we need now is anoth war
p292
aVbut the fact of the matter is he say they re work and the fact is that they are be crippl by them and we ve made it clear big nation can t bluff this presid doesn t bluff
p293
aVi don t know how long it will take we can and we will get it under 6 percent let s look at let s take a look at the fact let s look at where we were when we came to offic the economi was in free fall we had the great recess hit 9 million peopl lost their job 1 7 1 6 trillion in wealth lost in equiti in your home in retir account for the middl class
p294
aVwe knew we had to act for the middl class we immedi went out and rescu general motor we went ahead and made sure that we cut tax for the middl class and in addit to that when that when that occur what did romney do romney said no let detroit go bankrupt we move in and help peopl refin their home governor romney said no let foreclosur hit the bottom
p295
aVbut it shouldn t be surpris for a guy who say 47 percent of the american peopl are unwil to take respons for their own live my friend recent in a speech in washington said 30 percent of the american peopl are taker
p296
aVthese peopl are my mom and dad the peopl i grew up with my neighbor they pay more effect tax than governor romney pay in his feder incom tax they are elder peopl who in fact are live off of social secur they are veteran and peopl fight in afghanistan right now who are quot not pay ani tax
p297
aVi ve had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent it s about time they take some respons here and instead of sign pledg to grover norquist not to ask the wealthiest among us to contribut to bring back the middl class they should be sign a pledg say to the middl class we re go to level the play field we re go to give you a fair shot again we are go to not repeat the mistak we made in the past by have a differ set of rule for wall street and main street make sure that we continu to hemorrhag these tax cut for the super wealthi
p298
aVthey re push the continu of a tax cut that will give an addit 500 billion in tax cut to 120 000 famili and they re hold hostag the middl class tax cut becaus they say we won t pass we won t continu the middl class tax cut unless you give the tax cut for the super wealthi
p299
aVit s about time they take some respons
p300
aVjoe and i are from similar town he s from scranton pennsylvania i m from janesvill wisconsin you know what the unemploy rate in scranton is today
p301
aVi sure do
p302
aVit s 10 percent

p306
aVthat s how it s go all around america
p307
aVlook
p308
aVyou don t read the statist that s not how it s go it s go down
p309
aVwe mourn the loss of these four american who were murder
p310
aVlook did they come in and inherit a tough situat absolut but we re go in the wrong direct look at where we are the economi is bare limp along it s grow a 1 3 percent that s slower than it grew last year and last year was slower than the year befor
p311
aVjob growth in septemb was slower than it was in august and august was slower than it was in juli we re head in the wrong direct 23 million american are struggl for work today 15 percent of american are live in poverti today this is not what a real recoveri look like we need real reform for real recoveri and that s exact what mitt romney and i are propos it s a five point plan get america energi independ in north america by the end of the decad help peopl who are hurt get the skill they need to get the job they want get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisi
p312
aVmake trade work for america so we can make more thing in america and sell them oversea and champion small busi don t rais tax on small busi becaus they re our job creator
p313
aVhe talk about detroit mitt romney s a car guy they keep misquot him but let me tell you about the mitt romney i know this is a guy who i was talk to a famili in northborough massachusett the other day sheryl and mark nixon their kid were hit in a car crash four of them two of them rob and reed were paralyz the romney didn t know them they went to the same church they never met befor
p314
aVmitt ask if he could come over on christma he brought his boy his wife and gift later on he said i know you re struggl mark don t worri about their colleg i ll pay for it
p315
aVwhen mark told me this stori becaus you know what mitt romney doesn t tell these stori the nixon told this stori when he told me this stori he said it wasn t the help the cash help it s that he gave his time and he has consist
p316
aVthis is a man who gave 30 percent of his incom to chariti more than the two of us combin mitt romney s a good man he care about 100 percent of american in this countri and with respect to that quot i think the vice presid veri well know that sometim the word don t come out of your mouth the right way
p317
aVbut i alway say what i mean and so doe romney
p318
aVwe want everybodi to succeed we want to get peopl out of poverti in the middl class onto a life of self suffici we believ in opportun and upward mobil that s what we re go to push for in a romney administr
p319
aVwhen you take a look at what has happen just in the last few week they sent the u n ambassador out to say that this was becaus of a protest and a youtub video it took the presid two week to acknowledg that this was a terrorist attack
p320
aVthe idea if you heard that that littl soliloquy on 47 percent and you think he just made a mistak then i think you re i i think i got a bridg to sell you
p321
aVlook i don t doubt his person generos and i understand what it s like when i was a littl younger than the congressman my wife was in an accid kill my daughter and my wife and my two son surviv i have sat in the home of mani peopl who ve gone through what i get through becaus the one thing you can give peopl solac is to know if they know you ve been through it that they can make it so i don t doubt his person commit to individu but you know what i know he had no commit to the automobil industri he just he said let it go bankrupt period let it drop out all this talk we save a million job two hundr thousand peopl are work today
p322
aVand i ve never met two guy who re more down on america across the board we re told everyth s go bad there are 5 2 million new job privat sector job we need more but 5 2 million if they d get out of the way if they d get out of the way and let us pass the tax cut for the middl class make it perman if they get out of the way and pass the pass the job bill if they get out of the way and let us allow 14 million peopl who are struggl to stay in their home becaus their mortgag are upsid down but they never miss a mortgag payment just get out of the way
p323
aVstop talk about how you care about peopl show me someth show me a polici show me a polici where you take respons

aVand by the way they talk about this great recess if it fell out of the sky like oh my good where did it come from it came from this man vote to put two war on a credit card to at the same time put a prescript drug benefit on the credit card a trillion dollar tax cut for the veri wealthi i was there i vote against them i said no we can t afford that
p325
aVand now all of a sudden these guy are so seiz with the concern about the debt that they creat
p326
aVlet s not forget that they came in with one parti control when barack obama was elect his parti control everyth they had the abil to do everyth of their choos and look at where we are right now
p327
aVthey pass the stimulus the idea that we could borrow 831 billion spend it on all of these special interest group and that it would work out just fine that unemploy would never get to 8 percent it went up abov 8 percent for 43 month they said that right now if we just pass this stimulus the economi would grow at 4 percent it s grow at 1 3
p328
aVhe went to the u n and in his speech at the u n he said six time he talk about the youtub video
p329
aVthat s what our entir premis of our pro growth plan for a stronger middl class is all about get the economi grow at 4 percent creat 12 million job over the next four year
p330
aVlook at just the 90 billion in stimulus the vice presid was in charg of overse this 90 billion in green pork to campaign contributor and special interest group there are just at the depart of energi over 100 crimin investig that have been launch into just how stimulus

p343
aVand all this talk about cronyism they investig and investig did not find one singl piec of evid i wish he would just tell be a littl more candid
p344
aVwas it a good idea to spend taxpay dollar on electr car in finland or on windmil in china

aVwas it a good idea to borrow all this money from countri like china and spend it on all these various differ interest group
p347
aVthis is becom more troubl by the day they first blame the youtub video now they re tri to blame the romney ryan ticket for make this an issu
p348
aVlet me tell you what was a good idea it was a good idea moodi s and other said that this was exact what we need to stop this from go off the cliff it set the condit to be abl to grow again we have in fact 4 percent of those green job didn t go under went under didn t work it s a better bat averag than invest banker have they have about a 40 percent
p349

aVby the way ani letter you send me i ll entertain
p351
aVi appreci that joe
p352
aVabsolut medicar and social secur are go bankrupt these are indisput fact
p353
aVlook when i look at these program we ve all had tragedi in our live i think about what they ve done for my own famili my mom and i had my grandmoth move in with us who was face alzheim s medicar was there for here just like it s there for my mom right now who is a florida senior
p354
aVwith respect to iraq we had the same posit befor the withdraw which was we agre with the obama administr let s have a status of forc agreement to make sure that we secur our gain the vice presid was put in charg of those negoti by presid obama and they fail to get the agreement we don t have a status of forc agreement becaus they fail to get one that s what we are talk about
p355
aVafter my dad die my mom and i got social secur survivor benefit help me pay for colleg it help her go back to colleg in her 50s where she start a small busi becaus of the new skill she got she paid all of her tax on the promis that these program would be there for her
p356
aVwe will honor this promis and the best way to do it is reform it for my generat
p357
aVyou see if you reform these program for my generat peopl 54 and below you can guarante they don t chang for peopl in or near retir which is precis what mitt romney and i are propos
p358
aVlook what look what obamacar doe obamacar take 716 billion from medicar to spend on obamacar even their own chief actuari at medicar back this up he say you can t spend the same dollar twice you can t claim that this money goe to medicar and obamacar
p359
aVand then they put this new obamacar board in charg of cut medicar each and everi year in way that will lead to deni care for current senior
p360
aVthis board by the way it s 15 peopl the presid s suppos to appoint them next year and not one of them even has to have medic train
p361
aVand social secur if we don t shore up social secur when we run out of the ious when the program goe bankrupt a 25 percent across the board benefit cut kick in on current senior in the middl of their retir we re go to stop that from happen
p362
aVthey haven t put a credibl solut on the tabl he ll tell you about voucher he ll say all these thing to tri and scare peopl here s what we re say give younger peopl when they becom medicar elig guarante coverag option that you can t be deni includ tradit medicar choos your plan and then medicar subsid your premium not as much for the wealthi peopl more coverag for middl incom peopl and total out of pocket coverag for the poor and the sick
p363
aVchoic and competit we would rather have 50 million futur senior determin how their medicar is deliv to them instead of 15 bureaucrat decid what if when where they get it
p364
aVnow when it come to our veteran we owe them a great debt of gratitud for what they ve done for us includ your son beau but we also want to make sure that we don t lose the thing we fought so hard to get
p365
aVyou know i heard that death panel argument from sarah palin it seem everi vice presidenti debat i hear this kind of stuff about panel
p366
aVbut let s talk about medicar what we did is we save 716 billion and put it back appli it to medicar we cut the cost of medicar we stop overpay insur compani doctor and hospit the ama support what we did aarp endors what we did and it extend the life of medicar to 2024 they want to wipe this all out
p367
aVit also gave more benefit ani senior out there ask yourself do you have more benefit today you do if you re near the donut hole you have 800 600 more to help your prescript drug cost you get well visit without co pay they wipe all of this out and medicar goe becom insolv in 2016 number one
p368
aVnumber two guarante benefit it s a voucher when they first propos when the congressman had his first voucher program the cbo said it would cost 6 400 a year martha more for everi senior 55 and below when they got there he knew that yet he got all the guy in congress and women in the republican parti to vote for it governor romney know that said i would sign it were i there
p369
aVwho you believ the ama me a guy who s fought his whole life for this or somebodi who would actual put in motion a plan that know cut ad 6 400 a year more to the cost of medicar
p370
aVnow they got a new plan trust me it s not go to cost you ani more folk follow your instinct on this one
p371
aVand with regard to social secur we will not we will not privat it if we had listen to romney governor romney and the congressman dure the bush year imagin where all those senior would be now if their money had been in the market
p372
aVtheir idea are old and their idea are bad and they elimin the guarante of medicar
p373
aVhere s the problem they got caught with their hand in the cooki jar turn medicar into a piggybank for obamacar their own actuari from the administr came to congress and said one out of six hospit and nurs home are go to go out of busi as a result of this
p374
aVthat s not what they said
p375
aVnow with respect to afghanistan the 2014 deadlin we agre with a 2014 transit but what we also want it do is make sure that we re not project weak abroad and that s what s happen here
p376
aV7 4 million senior are project to lose their current medicar advantag coverag they have that s a 3 200 benefit cut
p377
aVthat didn t happen
p378
aVwhat we re say

aVthese are from your own actuari
p381
aVmore more more peopl sign up for medicar advantag after the chang
p382
aVwhat there s
p383
aVnobodi is
p384
aVmr vice presid i know

p386
aVthis benghazi issu would be a tragedi in and of itself but unfortun it s indic of a broader problem and that is what we are watch on our tv screen is the unravel of the obama foreign polici which is make the
p387
aVmr vice presid i know you re under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground but i think peopl would be better serv if we don t keep interrupt each other
p388
aVwell don t take all the four minut then
p389

aVhundr percent coverag
p391
aVthat s what we re say so we re say
p392
aVincom adjust
p393
aVlook this is a plan by the way that 6 400 number it was mislead then it s total inaccur now this is a plan that s bipartisan it s a plan i put togeth with a promin democrat senat from oregon
p394
aVthere s not one democrat who endors it
p395
aVit s a plan
p396
aVnot one democrat who
p397
aVour partner is a democrat from oregon
p398
aVand he said he doe no longer support
p399
aVwe we we put it we put it togeth with the former clinton budget director
p400
aVwho disavow it
p401
aVthis idea this idea came from the clinton commiss to save medicar chair by senat john breaux
p402
aVhere s the point martha
p403
aVwhich was reject
p404
aVon that same day the obama administr had the exact same posit let s recal that they disavow their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in cairo so we had the same posit but we will it s never too earli to speak out for our valu
p405
aVif we don t if we don t fix this problem pretti soon then current senior get cut here s the problem 10 000 peopl are retir everi singl day in america today and they will for 20 year that s not a polit thing that s a math thing
p406
aVmartha if we just did one thing if we just if they just allow medicar to bargain for the cost of drug like medicaid can that would save 156 billion right off the bat
p407
aVand it would deni senior choic
p408
aVall all all
p409
aVit has a restrict
p410
aVsenior are not deni
p411
aVabsolut
p412
aVthey are not deni
p413
aVlook folk all you senior out there have you been deni choic have you lost medicar advantag
p414
aVbecaus it s work well right now
p415
aVwe should have spoken out right away when the green revolut was up and start when the mullah in iran were attack their peopl we should not have call bashar assad a reform when he was turn his russian provid gun on his own peopl we should alway stand up for peac for democraci for individu right
p416
aVbecaus we ve chang the law
p417
aVlook i was there when we did that with social secur in 1983 i was one of eight peopl sit in the room that includ tip o neill negoti with presid reagan we all got togeth and everybodi said as long as everybodi s in the deal everybodi s in the deal and everybodi is make some sacrific we can find a way
p418
aVwe made the system solvent to 2033 we will not though be part of ani voucher plan elimin the voucher say mom when you re when you re 65 go out there shop for the best insur you can get you re out of medicar you can buy back in if you want with this voucher which will not keep pace will not keep pace with health care cost becaus if it did keep pace with health care cost there would be no save that s whi they go the voucher they we will be no part of a voucher program or the privat of social secur
p419
aVa voucher is you go to your mailbox get a check and buy someth nobodi s propos that barack obama four year ago run for presid said if you don t have ani fresh idea use stale tactic to scare voter if you don t have a good record to run on paint your oppon as someon peopl should run from
p420
aVfor younger peopl what we said then and what i ve alway agre is let younger american have a voluntari choic of make their money work faster for them within the social secur system
p421
aVyou saw how well that work
p422
aVthat s not what mitt romney s propos what we re say is no chang for anybodi 55 and abov
p423
aVwhat mitt romney is propos
p424
aVand we should not be impos these devast defens cut becaus what that doe when we equivoc on our valu when we show that we re cut down on defens it make us more weak it project weak and when we look weak our adversari are much more will to test us they re more brazen in their attack and are alli are less will to
p425
aVand then the kind of chang we re talk about for younger peopl like myself is don t increas the benefit for wealthi peopl as fast as everybodi els slowli rais the retir age over time
p426
aVmartha
p427
aVit wouldn t get to the age of 70 until the year 2103 accord to the actuari
p428
aVnow here s
p429
aVquick the bottom line here is that all the studi show that if we went with social secur propos made by mitt romney if you re 40 in your 40s now you will pay 2 600 a year you get 2 600 a year less in social secur if you re in your 20s now you get 4 700
p430
aVthe idea of chang and chang be in this case to cut the benefit for peopl without take other action you could do to make it work is absolut the wrong way
p431
aVthese look these guy haven t been big on medicar from the begin their parti s not been big on medicar from the begin and they ve alway been about social secur as littl as you can do
p432
aVlook folk use your common sens who do you trust on this a man who introduc a bill that would rais it 40 6 400 a year know it and pass it and romney say he d sign it or me and the presid
p433
aVthat statist was complet mislead but more import
p434
aVwith all due respect that s a bunch of malarkey
p435
aVthat s there are the fact right
p436
aVthis is what politician do when they don t have a record to run on tri to scare peopl from vote for you if you don t get ahead of this problem it s go to
p437
aVmedicar beneficiari there are more beneficiari
p438
aVwe re not go to run away medicar and social secur did so much for my own famili we are not go to jeopard this program but we have to save it
p439
aVyou are jeopard this program you re chang the program from a guarante benefit to premium support whatev you call it the bottom line is peopl are go to have to pay more money out of their pocket and the famili i know and the famili i come from they don t have the money to pay more out
p440
aVthat s whi we re say more for lower incom peopl and less for higher incom peopl
p441
aVi gave you a simpl answer he s rais the cost of medicar
p442
aVthe middl class will pay less and peopl make 1 million or more will begin to contribut slight more let me give you one concret exampl the continu of the bush tax cut we are argu that the bush tax cut for the wealthi should be allow to expir of the bush tax cut for the wealthi 800 million billion of that goe to peopl make a minimum of 1 million
p443
aVwe see no justif in these econom time for those and they re patriot american they re not ask for this continu tax cut they re not suggest it but my friend are insist on it 120 000 famili by continu that tax cut will get an addit 500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 year and their incom is an averag of 8 million
p444
aVwe want to extend perman the middl class tax cut for perman from the bush middl class tax cut these guy won t allow us to you know what they re say we say let s have a vote let s have a vote on the middl class tax cut and let s have a vote on the upper tax cut let s go ahead and vote on it
p445
aVthey re say no they re hold hostag the middl class tax cut to the super wealthi and on top of that they ve got anoth tax cut come that s 5 trillion that all of the studi point out will in fact give anoth 250 million yeah 250 000 a year to those 120 000 famili and rais tax for peopl who are middl incom with a child by 2 000 a year
p446
aVthis is unconscion there is no need for this the middl class got knock on their heel the great recess crush them they need some help now the last peopl who need help are 120 000 famili for anoth anoth 500 billion tax cut over the next 10 year
p447
aVour entir premis of these tax reform plan is to grow the economi and creat job it s a plan that s estim to creat 7 million job now we think that govern take 28 percent of a famili and busi s incom is enough presid obama think that the govern ought to be abl to take as much as 44 8 percent of a small busi s incom
p448
aVlook if you tax everi person and success busi make over 250 000 at 100 percent it would onli run the govern for 98 day if everybodi who paid incom tax last year includ success small busi doubl their incom tax this year we d still have a 300 billion deficit you see there aren t enough rich peopl and small busi to tax to pay for all their spend
p449
aVand so the next time you hear them say don t worri about it we ll get a few wealthi peopl to pay their fair share watch out middl class the tax bill s come to you
p450
aVthat s whi we re say we need fundament tax reform let s take a look at it this way eight out of 10 busi they file their tax as individu not as corpor and where i come from oversea which is lake superior the canadian they drop their tax rate to 15 percent the averag tax rate on busi in the industri world is 25 percent and the presid want the top effect tax rate on success small busi to go abov 40 percent
p451
aVbecaus not a singl thing he said is accur first of all
p452
aVtwo third of our job come from small busi this one tax would actual tax about 53 percent of small busi incom it s expect to cost us 710 000 job and you know what it doesn t even pay for 10 percent of their propos deficit spend increas
p453
aVwhat we are say is lower tax rate across the board and close loophol primarili to the higher incom peopl we have three bottom line don t rais the deficit don t rais tax on the middl class and don t lower the share of incom that is born by the high incom earner
p454
aVhe ll keep say this 5 trillion plan i suppos it s been discredit by six other studi and even their own deputi campaign manag acknowledg that it wasn t correct
p455
aVdiffer than this administr we actual want to have big bipartisan agreement you see i understand the
p456
aVthat would that would be a first for the republican congress
p457
aVlook look at what mitt romney look at what ronald reagan and tip o neill did they work togeth out of a framework to lower tax rate and broaden the base and they work togeth to fix that
p458
aVwhat we re say is here s our framework lower tax rate 20 percent we rais about 1 2 trillion through incom tax we forego about 1 1 trillion in loophol and deduct and so what we re say is deni those loophol and deduct to higher incom taxpay so that more of their incom is tax which has a broader base of taxat
p459
aVcan i translat
p460
aVso we can lower tax rate across the board now here s whi i m say this what we re say is here s the framework
p461
aVi hope i m go to get time to respond to this
p462
aVwe want to work with congress we want to work with the congress on how best to achiev this that mean success look
p463
aVmitt what we re say is lower tax rate 20 percent start with the wealthi work with congress to do it
p464
aVabsolut six studi have guarante six studi have verifi that this math add up but here s
p465
aVi will be veri specif number one the this lectur on embassi secur the congressman here cut embassi secur in his budget by 300 million below what we ask for number one so much for the embassi secur piec
p466
aVlook
p467
aVi ll come back in a second then right
p468
aVfirst of all i was there when ronald reagan tax break he gave specif of what he was go to cut number one in term of tax expenditur number two 97 percent of the small busi in america pay less make less than 250 000 let me tell you who some of those other small busi are hedg fund that make 600 million 800 million a year that s that s what they count as small busi becaus they re pass through
p469
aVlet s look at how sincer they are ronald i mean excus me governor romney on 60 minut i guess it was about 10 day ago was ask governor you pay 14 percent on 20 million someon make 50 000 pay more than that do you think that s fair he said oh yes that s fair that s fair
p470
aVthis is and they re go to talk you think these guy are go to go out there and cut those loophol the loophol the biggest loophol they take advantag of is the carri interest loophol and and capit gain loophol they exempt that
p471
aVnow there s not enough the reason whi the aei studi the american enterpris institut studi the tax polici center studi the reason they all say it s go tax go up on the middl class the onli way you can find 5 trillion in loophol is cut the mortgag deduct for middl class peopl cut the health care deduct middl class peopl take away their abil to get a tax break to send their kid to colleg that s whi they arriv at it
p472
aVhe is wrong about that they re
p473
aVhow s that
p474
aVyou can you can cut tax rate by 20 percent and still preserv these import prefer for middl class taxpay
p475
aVnumber two governor romney befor he knew the fact befor he even knew that our ambassador was kill he was out make a polit statement which was pan by the media around the world and this talk about this this weak i i don t understand what my friend s talk about here
p476
aVnot mathemat possibl
p477
aVit is mathemat possibl it s been done befor it s precis what we re propos
p478
aVit has never been done befor
p479
aVit s been done a coupl of time actual
p480
aVit has never been done befor
p481
aVjack kennedi lower tax rate increas growth ronald reagan
p482
aVoh now you re jack kennedi
p483
aVronald reagan republican and democrat
p484
aVthis is amaz
p485
aVrepublican and democrat have work togeth on this
p486
aVwe this is a presid who s gone out and done everyth he has said he was go to do this is a guy who s repair our allianc so the rest of the world follow us again this is the guy who brought the entir world includ russia and china to bring about the most devast most devast the most devast effort on iran to make sure that they in fact stop
p487
aVthat s right
p488
aVyou know i understand you guy aren t use to do bipartisan deal
p489
aVbut we told each other what we re go to do
p490
aVrepublican and democrat
p491
aVwhen we did it reagan we said here here are the thing we re go to cut
p492
aVwe said here s the framework let s work togeth to fill in the detail that s exact
p493
aVfill in the detail
p494
aVthat s how you get thing done you work with congress look let me say it this way
p495
aVthat s come from a republican congress work bipartisan 7 percent rate come on
p496
aVmitt romney was governor of massachusett where 87 percent of the legisl he serv which were democrat he didn t demon them he didn t demagogu them he met with those parti leader everi week he reach across the aisl he didn t compromis principl
p497
aVlook i i just i mean these guy bet against america all the time
p498
aVand you saw what happen
p499
aVhe found common ground and he balanc the budget
p500
aVyou saw if he did such a great job
p501
aVfour time without rais tax
p502
aVwhi isn t he even contest massachusett
p503
aVjust let the tax expir like they re suppos to on those millionair we don t we can t afford 800 billion go to peopl make a minimum of 1 million they do not need it martha those 120 000 famili make 8 million a year middl class peopl need the help whi doe my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for them whi doe he go after the childcar
p504
aVwhi do they do that
p505
aVyeah we re say close loophol
p506
aVon high interest peopl
p507
aVfor higher incom peopl here
p508
aVcan you guarante that no one make less than 100 000 will have a mortgag their mortgag deduct impact guarante
p509
aVthis tax a million small busi he keep tri to make you think that it s just some movi star or hedg fund guy or an actor
p510
aVnineti seven percent of the small busi make less than 250 000 a year would not be affect
p511
aVjoe you know it hit a million this tax a million peopl a million small busi
p512
aVyeah sure
p513
aVdoe it tax 97 percent of the american busi
p514
aVit tax a million small busi
p515
aVsmall busi
p516
aVwho are our greatest job creator
p517
aVi wish i d get the greatest job creator are the hedg fund guy
p518
aVthink about it this way
p519
aVno we re not just go to cut the defens budget like they re they re propos
p520
aVthey re go to increas it 2 billion
p521
aVthat s not
p522
aVno we re say don t ok you want to get into defens now
p523
aVso right ok
p524
aVso they propos a 478 billion cut to defens to begin with now we have anoth 500 billion cut to defens that s lurk on the horizon they insist upon that cut be involv in the debt negoti and so we have a 1 trillion cut
p525
aVright ok
p526
aVbecaus that was exact what we were told by the intellig communiti the intellig communiti told us that as they learn more fact about exact what happen they chang their assess that s whi there s also an investig head by tom picker a lead diplomat from the reagan year who is do an investig as to whether or not there are ani laps what the laps were so that they will never happen again
p527
aVi d like to go back to that
p528
aVtwo trillion dollar
p529
aVyou don t cut defens by a trillion dollar that s what we re talk about
p530
aVwho s cut it by 1 trillion
p531
aVwe re go to cut 80 000 soldier 20 000 marin 120 cargo plane we re go to push the joint strike fighter out
p532
aVif these cut go through our navi will be the smallest the smallest it has been sinc befor world war i
p533
aVthis invit weak look do we believ in peac through strength you bet we do and that mean you don t impos these devast cut on our militari
p534
aVso we re say don t cut the militari by a trillion dollar not increas it by a trillion don t cut it by a trillion dollar
p535
aVlook we don t cut it and i might add this so call i know we don t want to use the fanci word sequest this automat cut that was part of a debt deal that they ask for
p536
aVand let me tell you what my friend said at a press confer announc his support of the deal he said and i m paraphras we ve been look for this moment for a long time
p537
aVcan i tell you what that meant
p538
aVand so the bipartisanship is what he vote for the automat cut in defens if they didn t act
p539
aVand beyond that they ask for anoth look the militari say we need a smaller leaner armi we need more special forc we need we don t need more m1 tank what we need is more uav
p540
aVnot some of the militari that was the decis of the joint chief of staff recommend to us and agre to by the presid that is a fact
p541
aVwell we weren t told they want more secur there we did not know they want more secur again and by the way at the time we were told exact we said exact what the intellig communiti told us that they knew that was the assess and as the intellig communiti chang their view we made it clear they chang their view
p542
aVthey made the recommend first
p543
aVcan i get into that for a second
p544
aVwe don t want to lose the gain we ve gotten we want to make sure that the taliban doe not come back in and give al qaida a safe haven
p545
aVwe agre with the administr on their 2014 transit
p546
aVlook when i think about afghanistan i think about the incred job that our troop have done you ve been there more than the two of us combin first time i was there in 2002 it was amaz to me what they were face when i went to the ahgandah
p547
aVand then to go back there in decemb to go throughout helmand with the marin to see what they had accomplish it s noth short of amaz
p548
aVthat s whi i said we will get to the bottom of this you know usual when there s a crisi we pull togeth we pull togeth as a nation but as i said even befor we knew what happen to the ambassador the governor was hold a press confer was hold a press confer that s not presidenti leadership
p549
aVwhat we don t want to do is lose the gain we ve gotten now we ve disagre from time to time on a few issu we would have more like taken into account the recommend from our command general petraeus admir mullen on troop level throughout this year s fight season we ve been skeptic about negoti with the taliban especi while they re shoot at us
p550
aVbut we want to see the 2014 transit be success and that mean we want to make sure our command have what they need to make sure that it is success so that this doe not onc again becom a launch pad for terrorist
p551
aVmartha let s keep our eye on the ball the reason i ve been in and out of afghanistan and iraq 20 time i ve been up in the konar
p552
aVthe fact is we went there for one reason to get those peopl who kill american al qaida we ve decim al qaida central we have elimin osama bin laden that was our purpos
p553
aVand in fact in the meantim what we said we would do we would help train the afghan militari it s their respons to take over their own secur that s whi with 49 of our alli in afghanistan we ve agre on a gradual drawdown so we re out of there by the year 20 in the year 2014
p554
aVmy friend and the governor say it s base on condit which mean it depend it doe not depend for us it is the respons of the afghan to take care of their own secur we have train over 315 000 most without incid there have been more than two dozen case of green on blue where american have been kill if we do not if the measur the militari has taken do not take hold we will not go on joint patrol we will not train in the field we ll onli train in the in the armi base that exist there
p555
aVbut we are leav we are leav in 2014 period and in the process we re go to be save over the next 10 year anoth 800 billion we ve been in this war for over a decad the primari object is almost complet now all we re do is put the kabul govern in a posit to be abl to maintain their own secur
p556
aVit s their respons not america s
p557
aVwe don t want to stay we want look one of my best friend in janesvill a reservist is at a forward oper base in eastern afghanistan right now our wive are best friend our daughter are best friend i want i want him and all of our troop to come home as soon and safe as possibl
p558
aVwe want to make sure that 2014 is success that s whi we want to make sure that we give our command what they say they need to make it success we don t want to extend beyond 2014 that s the point we re make you know if it was just this i d feel like we would we would be abl to call this a success but it s not what we are wit as we turn on our televis screen these day is the absolut unravel of the obama foreign polici problem are grow at home but problem are grow abroad but job aren t grow here at home
p559
aVdo you know whi we say that
p560
aVi d like to know
p561
aVbecaus we don t want to broadcast to our enemi put a date on your calendar wait us out and then come back we want to make sure
p562
aVwe do agre we do agre with the timelin and the transit but what we what ani administr will do in 2013 is assess the situat to see how best to complet this timelin what we do not want to do
p563
aVwe will leav in 2014
p564
aVwhat we don t want to do is give our alli reason to trust us less and our enemi more we don t want to embolden our enemi to hold and wait out for us and then take over
p565
aVoh gosh yes urin on taliban corps what we should not apolog for
p566
aVmartha that s a bizarr statement
p567
aVthat s whi we want to make sure no that s whi we want to make sure that
p568
aVforti nine of our alli hear me 49 of our alli sign on to this posit
p569
aVand we re read that they want to
p570
aVforti nine 49 of our alli said out in 2014 it s the respons of the afghan we have other respons
p571
aVwhich is which is
p572
aVlook the taliban what we ve found out and we you saw it in iraq martha unless you set a timelin baghdad in the case of iraq and and kabul in the case of afghanistan will not step up they re happi to let us continu to do the job intern secur forc to do the job
p573
aVthe onli way they step up is to say fella we re leav we ve train you step up step up
p574
aVthat s the onli way it work
p575
aVthe militari reason
p576
aVwas bring by the way when the presid announc the surg you ll rememb martha he said the surg will be out by the end of the summer the militari said the surg will be out noth polit about this
p577
aVbefor the surg occur so you be a littl straight with me here too befor the surg occur we said they ll be out by the end of the summer that s what the militari said the reason for that is
p578
aVsure there are peopl that are concern but not the joint chief that was their recommend in the oval offic to the presid of the unit state of america i sat there i m sure you ll find someon who disagre with the pentagon i m posit you ll find that within the militari but that s not the case here
p579
aVand second the reason whi the militari said that is you cannot wait and have a cliff it take you know month and month and month to draw down forc
p580
aVwhat what we should not be apolog for are stand up for our valu what we should not be do is say to the egyptian peopl while mubarak is crack down on them that he s a good guy and in the next week say he ought to go
p581
aVlet me
p582
aVhere s the way it work the mountain pass fill in with snow the taliban and the terrorist and the haqqani and the quetta shura come over from pakistan to fight our men and women when it fill in with snow they can t do it that s what we call fight season in the warm month fight get realli high in the winter it goe down
p583
aVand so when admir mullen and general petraeus came to congress and said if you pull these peopl out befor the fight season is end it put peopl more at risk that s the problem
p584
aVyes we drew 22 000 troop down last month but the remain troop that are there who still have the same mission to prosecut counterinsurg are do it with fewer peopl that make them less safe
p585
aVfight season
p586
aVwe re send fewer peopl out in all of these hotspot to do the same job that they were suppos to do a month ago
p587
aVbecaus we turn it over
p588
aVbut we took 22 000 peopl out
p589
aVwe turn it over to the afghan troop we train no one got pull out that didn t get fill in by train afghan personnel and he s he s conflat two issu the fight season that petraeus was talk about and former and admir mullen was the fight season this spring that s what he was talk about we did not we did not pull them out
p590
aVthe calendar work the same everi year
p591
aVwhat we should not be do is reject claim for for call for more secur in our barrack in our marin we need marin in benghazi when the command on the ground say we need more forc for secur there were request for extra secur those request were not honor
p592
aVit doe work the same everi year but we re not stay there
p593
aVspring summer fall it s warm or it s not they re still fight us they re still come over the pass they re still come into zabul to kunar to all of these area but we are send fewer peopl to the front to fight them and that s
p594
aVthat s right becaus that s the afghan respons we ve train them
p595
aVnot in the east
p596
aVnot in the east
p597
aVr c east r c east
p598
aVr c east is the most danger place in the world
p599
aVthat s right that s whi we don t want to send fewer peopl to the
p600
aVthat s that s whi we should send american in to do the job instead of the you d rather american be go in do the job instead of the traine
p601
aVlook this was the anniversari of 9 11 it was libya a countri we knew we had al qaida cell there as we know al qaida and it affili are on the rise in northern africa and we did not give our ambassador in benghazi a marin detach
p602
aVno we are alreadi send american to do the job but fewer of them that s the whole problem
p603
aVthat s right we re send in more afghan to do the job afghan to do the job
p604
aVdiffer countri it s a differ countri it is five time as larg geograph it has one fifth the popul that is libya one fifth the popul five time as larg geograph
p605
aVit s in a part of the world where they re not go to see whatev would come from that war it seep into a region war
p606
aVyou re in a countri that is heavili popul in the midst of the most danger area in the world and in fact if in fact it blow up and the wrong peopl gain control it s go to have impact on the entir region caus potenti region war
p607
aVwe are work hand and glove with the turk with the jordanian with the saudi and with all the peopl in the region attempt to identifi the peopl who deserv the help so that when assad goe and he will go there will be a legitim govern that follow on not an al qaida sponsor govern that follow on
p608
aVand all this loos talk of my friend governor romney and the congressman about how we re go to do we could do so much more in there what more would they do other than put american boot on the ground
p609
aVthe last thing america need is to get in anoth ground war in the middl east requir ten of thousand if not well over 100 000 american forc that they are the fact they are the fact
p610
aVnow everi time the governor is ask about this he doesn t say anyth he he goe up with a whole lot of verbiag but when he get press he say no he would not do anyth differ than we are do now
p611
aVof cours there s an investig so we can make sure that this never happen again but when it come to speak up for our valu we should not apolog for those here s the problem look at all the various issu out there and it s unravel befor our eye the vice presid talk about sanction on iran they got we ve had four
p612
aVare they propos put american troop on the ground put american aircraft in the airspac is that what they re propos if they do they should speak up and say so but that s not what they re say
p613
aVwe are do it exact like we need to do to identifi those forc who in fact will provid for a stabl govern and not caus a region sunni shia war when bassad when bashar assad fall
p614
aVnobodi is propos to send troop to syria american troop
p615
aVnow let me say it this way how would we do thing differ we wouldn t refer to bashar assad as a reform when he s kill his own civilian with his russian provid weapon we wouldn t be outsourc our foreign polici to the unit nation give vladimir putin veto power over our effort to tri and deal with this issu he s veto three of them
p616
aVhillari clinton went to russia to tri and convinc them not to do so they thwart her effort she said they were on the wrong side of histori she was right about that this is just one more exampl of how the russia reset s not work
p617
aVand so where are we after intern pressur mount the presid obama said bashar assad should go it s been over a year the man has slaughter ten of thousand of his own peopl and more foreign fighter are spill into this countri
p618
aVso the longer this has gone on the more peopl group like al qaida are go in we could have more easili identifi the free syrian armi the freedom fighter work with our alli the turk the qatari the saudi had we had a better plan in place to begin with work through our alli but no we wait for kofi annan to tri and come up with an agreement through the u n that bought bashar assad time
p619
aVwe gave russia veto power over our effort through the u n and meanwhil about 30 000 syrian are dead
p620
aVwhat would my friend do differ if you notic he never answer the question
p621
aVno i would i we would not be go through the u n in all of these thing
p622
aVlet me you don t go through the u n we are in the process now and have been for month in make sure that help humanitarian aid as well as other aid and train is get to those forc that we believ the turk believ the jordanian believ the saudi believ are the free forc insid of syria that is underway
p623
aVour alli were all on the same page nato as well as our arab alli in term of tri to get a settlement that was their idea we re the one that said enough with regard to the reset not work the fact of the matter is that russia has a differ interest in syria than we do and that s not in our interest
p624
aVthen iran keep their greatest alli in the region he s a sponsor of terror he ll probabl continu slaughter his peopl we and the world communiti will lose our credibl on this look he mention the reset
p625
aVwell we agre with the same red line actual they do on chemic weapon but not put american troop in other than to secur those chemic weapon they re right about that
p626
aVbut what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom fighter those dissid in syria we should not have call bashar assad a reform and
p627
aVwe should not have we should not have wait to russia
p628
aVwhat is was it was a tragedi martha it chris steven was one of our best we lost three other brave american
p629
aVabsolut
p630
aVshould not have wait for russia to give us the green light at the u n to do someth about it
p631
aVrussia
p632
aVthey re they re still arm the man iran is fli flight over iraq
p633
aVand the opposit is be arm
p634
aVto help bashar assad and by the way if we had the status of forc agreement that the vice presid said he would bet his vice presid on in iraq we probabl would have been abl to prevent that but he fail to achiev that as well again
p635
aVi don t
p636
aVyeah
p637
aVin syria
p638
aVwhat is in the nation interest of the american peopl
p639
aVwhat is in the nation secur of the american peopl it s got to be in the strateg nation interest of our countri
p640
aVeach situat will will come up with it own set of circumst but put american troop on the ground that s got to be within the nation secur interest of the american peopl
p641
aVthat mean like embargo and sanction and overflight those are thing that don t put american troop on the ground but if you re talk about put american troop on the ground onli in our nation secur interest
p642
aVwe cannot allow iran to gain a nuclear weapon capabl now let s take a look at where we ve gone come from when barack obama was elect they had enough fissil materi nuclear materi to make one bomb now they have enough for five they re race toward a nuclear weapon they re four year closer toward a nuclear weapon capabl
p643
aVsure
p644
aVi don t see how a person can separ their public life from their privat life or from their faith our faith inform us in everyth we do my faith inform me about how to take care of the vulner of how to make sure that peopl have a chanc in life
p645
aVnow you want to ask basic whi i m pro life it s not simpli becaus of my cathol faith that s a factor of cours but it s also becaus of reason and scienc
p646
aVyou know i think about 10 1 2 year ago my wife janna and i went to merci hospit in janesvill where i was born for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child and we saw that heartbeat a littl babi was in the shape of a bean and to this day we have nicknam our firstborn child liza bean now i believ that life begin at concept
p647
aVthat s whi those are the reason whi i m pro life now i understand this is a difficult issu and i respect peopl who don t agre with me on this but the polici of a romney administr will be to oppos abort with the except for rape incest and life of the mother what troubl me more is how this administr has handl all of these issu look at what they re do through obamacar with respect to assault the religi liberti of this countri they re infring upon our first freedom the freedom of religion by infring on cathol chariti cathol church cathol hospit
p648
aVour church should not have to sue our feder govern to maintain their religi liberti and with respect to abort the democrat parti use to say they want it to be safe legal and rare now they support it without restrict and with taxpay fund taxpay fund in obamacar taxpay fund with foreign aid the vice presid himself went to china and said that he sympath and wouldn t second guess their one child polici of forc abort and steril that to me is pretti extrem
p649
aVwe ve had four differ sanction the u n on iran three from the bush administr one here and the onli reason we got it is becaus russia water it down and prevent the the sanction from hit the central bank
p650
aVmy religion defin who i am and i ve been a practic cathol my whole life and has particular inform my social doctrin the cathol social doctrin talk about take care of those who who can t take care of themselv peopl who need help with regard to with regard to abort i accept my church s posit on abort as a what we call a
p651
aVbut i refus to impos it on equal devout christian and muslim and jew and i just refus to impos that on other unlik my friend here the the congressman i i do not believ that we have a right to tell other peopl that women they can t control their bodi it s a decis between them and their doctor in my view and the suprem court i m not go to interfer with that with regard to the assault on the cathol church let me make it absolut clear no religi institut cathol or otherwis includ cathol social servic georgetown hospit merci hospit ani hospit none has to either refer contracept none has to pay for contracept none has to be a vehicl to get contracept in ani insur polici they provid that is a fact
p652
aVthat is a fact now with regard to the way in which the we differ my friend say that he well i guess he accept governor romney s posit now becaus in the past he has argu that there was there s rape and forcibl rape he s argu that in the case of rape or incest it was still it would be a crime to engag in have an abort i just fundament disagre with my friend
p653
aVall i m say is if you believ that life begin at concept that therefor doesn t chang the definit of life that s a principl the polici of a romney administr is to oppos abort with except for rape incest and life of the mother
p654
aVnow i ve got to take issu with the cathol church and religi liberti
p655
aVyou have on the issu
p656
aS''
p657
aVwhi would they keep whi would they keep su you it s a distinct without a differ
p658
aVmitt romney propos these sanction in 2007 in congress i ve been fight for these sanction sinc 2009 the administr was block us everi step of the way onli becaus we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanction were we abl to overrul their object and put them in spite of the administr
p659
aVwe don t think that unelect judg should make this decis that peopl through their elect repres in reach a consensus in societi through the democrat process should make this determin
p660
aVthe court the next presid will get one or two suprem court nomine that s how close roe v wade is just ask yourself with robert bork be the chief advis on the court for for mr romney who do you think he s like to appoint do you think he s like to appoint someon like scalia or someon els on the court far right that would outlaw
p661
aVi guarante you that will not happen we pick two peopl we pick peopl who are open mind they ve been good justic so keep an eye on the suprem court
p662
aVwas there a litmus test on them
p663
aVthere was no litmus test we pick peopl who had an open mind did not come with an agenda
p664
aVimagin what would have happen if we had these sanction in place earlier you think iran s not brazen look at what they re do they re step up their terrorist attack they tri a terrorist attack in the unit state last year when they tri to blow up the saudi ambassador at a restaur in washington d c
p665
aVi would say to him the same thing i say to my son who did serv a year in iraq that we onli have one truli sacr oblig as a govern that s to equip those we send into harm s way and care for those who come home that s the onli sacr oblig we have everyth els fall behind that
p666
aVi would also tell him that the fact that he this decor soldier you talk about fought for his countri that that should be honor he should not be thrown into a categori of a 47 percent who don t pay their tax while he was out there fight and not have to pay tax and somehow not take respons
p667
aVi would also tell him that there are thing that have occur in this campaign and occur in everi campaign that i m sure both of us regret anyon have said particular in these these special new group that can go out there rais all the money they want not have to identifi themselv who say the most scurril thing about the other candid it s it s an abomin
p668
aVbut the bottom line here is i d ask that hero you referenc to take a look at whether or not governor romney or presid obama has the convict to help lift up the middl class restor them to where they were befor this great recess hit and they got wipe out or whether or not he s go to continu to focus on take care of onli the veri wealthi not ask them to make pay ani part of the deal to bring bring back the middl class and the economi of this countri
p669
aVi d ask him to take a look at whether the presid of the unit state has act wise in the use of forc and whether or not the slipshod comment be made by my my or by governor romney serv serv our interest veri well
p670
aVbut there are thing that have been said in campaign that i i find not veri appeal
p671
aVfirst of all i d thank him to his servic to our countri
p672
aVsecond of all i d say we are not go to impos these devast cut on our militari which compromis their mission and their safeti
p673
aVand then i would say you have a presid who ran for presid four year ago promis hope and chang who has now turn his campaign into attack blame and defam
p674
aVand talk about credibl when this administr say that all option are on the tabl they send out senior administr offici that send all these mix signal
p675
aVyou see if you don t have a good record to run on then you paint your oppon as someon to run from that was what presid obama said in 2008 it s what he s do right now
p676
aVlook at all the string of broken promis if you like your health care plan you can keep it tri tell that to the 20 million peopl who are project to lose their health insur if obamacar goe through or the 7 point million 7 4 million senior who are go to lose it
p677
aVor rememb when he said this i guarante if you make less than 250 000 your tax won t go up of the 21 tax increas in obamacar 12 of them hit the middl class
p678
aVor rememb when he said health insur premium will go down 2 500 per famili per year they ve gone up 3 000 and they re expect to go up anoth 2 400
p679
aVor rememb when he said i promis by the end of my first term i ll cut the deficit in half in four year we ve had four budget four trillion dollar deficit
p680
aVa debt crisi is come we can t keep spend and borrow like this we can t keep spend money we don t have
p681
aVleader run to problem to fix problem presid obama has not even put a credibl plan on the tabl in ani of his four year to deal with this debt crisi i pass two budget to deal with this mitt romney s put idea on the tabl
p682
aVwe ve got to tackl this debt crisi befor it tackl us the presid like to say he has a plan he gave a speech we ask his budget offic can we see the plan they sent us to the press secretari he gave us a copi of the speech we ask the congression budget offic tell us what presid obama s plan is to prevent a debt crisi they said it s a speech we can t estim speech
p683
aVyou see that s what we get in this administr speech but we re not get leadership
p684
aVmitt romney is uniqu qualifi to fix these problem his lifetim of experi his proven track record of bipartisanship
p685
aVand so in order to solv this peac which is everybodi s goal you have to have the ayatollah chang their mind look at where they are they re move faster toward a nuclear weapon it s becaus this administr has no credibl on this issu it s becaus this administr water down sanction delay sanction tri to stop us for put the tough sanction in place
p686
aVand what do we have from the presid he broke his big promis to bring peopl togeth to solv the countri s biggest problem
p687
aVand what i would tell him is we don t have to settl for this
p688
aVmartha
p689
aVwe can do better than this
p690
aVi hope i ll get equal time
p691
aVthe two budget the congressman introduc have eviscer all the thing that the middl class care about it is
p692
aVit doe it doe virtual noth except continu to increas the tax cut for the veri wealthi and you know we ve had enough of this
p693
aVthe idea that he s so concern about these deficit i ve point out he vote to put two war on a credit card he did
p694
aVnow we have them in place becaus of congress they say the militari option s on the tabl but it s not be view as credibl and the key is to do this peac is to make sure that we have credibl under a romney administr we will have credibl on this issu
p695
aVnot rais tax is not cut tax and by the way our budget
p696
aVwe have not rais
p697
aVby 3 percent a year instead of 4 5 percent like they propos not spend more money as much as they say is not a spend cut
p698
aVhonesti no one els could there are plenti of fine peopl who could lead this countri but what you need are peopl who when they say they re go to do someth they go do it what you need are when peopl see problem they offer solut to fix those problem we re not get that
p699
aVlook we can grow this economi faster that s what our five point plan for a stronger middl class is all about it s about get 12 million job higher take home pay get peopl out of poverti into the middl class that mean go with proven pro growth polici that we know work to get peopl back to work put idea on the tabl work with democrat that actual work sometim and then
p700
aVwell he get 40 i get 15 that s ok
p701
aVthat s all right
p702
aVlet me tell you i my my record stand for itself i never say anyth i don t mean everybodi know whatev i say i do and my whole life has been devot to level the play field for middl class peopl give them an even break treat main street and wall street the same hold them to the same respons
p703
aVlook at my record it s been all about the middl class they re the peopl who grow this countri we think you grow this countri from the middl out not from the top down
p704
aVwell let let me say at the outset that i want to thank you martha for do this and centr colleg the fact is that we re in a situat where we inherit a god aw circumst peopl are in real troubl we act to move to bring relief to the peopl who need the most help now
p705
aVand and in the process we in case you haven t notic we have strong disagr but i you probabl detect my frustrat with their attitud about the american peopl my friend say that 30 percent of the american peopl are taker romney point out 47 percent of the peopl won t take respons
p706
aVhe s talk about my mother and father he s talk about the place i grew up in my neighbor in scranton and claymont and he s talk about he s talk about the peopl that have built this countri all they re look for martha all they re look for is an even shot whenev you give them the shot they ve done it they ve done it whenev you ve level the play field they ve been abl to move and they want a littl bit of peac of mind
p707
aVand the presid and i are not go to rest until that play field is level they in fact have a clear shot and they have peac of mind until they can turn to their kid and say with a degre of confid honey it s go to be ok it s go to be ok that s what this is all about
p708
aVi want to thank you as well martha danvill kentucki centr colleg and i want to thank you joe it s been an honor to engag in this critic debat
p709
aVwe face a veri big choic what kind of countri are we go to be what kind of countri are we go to give our kid presid obama he had his chanc he made his choic his econom agenda more spend more borrow higher tax a govern takeov of health care it s not work it s fail to creat the job we need
p710
aVi can make absolut two commit to you and all the american peopl tonight one we will find and bring to justic the men who did this and second we will get to the bottom of it and whatev wherev the fact lead us wherev they lead us we will make clear to the american public becaus whatev mistak were made will not be made again
p711
aVit s incred look imagin had we let the republican congress work out the sanction you think there s ani possibl the entir world would have join us russia and china all of our alli these are the most crippl sanction in the histori of sanction period period
p712
aVtwenti three million american are struggl for work today fifteen percent of american are in poverti this is not what a real recoveri look like you deserv better mitt romney and i want to earn your support we re offer real reform for a real recoveri for everi american
p713
aVmitt romney his experi his idea his solut is uniqu qualifi to get this job done at a time when we have a job crisi in america wouldn t it be nice to have a job creator in the white hous
p714
aVthe choic is clear a stagnant economi that promot more govern depend or a dynam grow economi that promot opportun and job mitt romney and i will not duck the tough issu and we will not blame other for the next four year we will take respons and we will not tri to replac our found principl we will reappli our found principl
p715
aVthe choic is clear and the choic rest with you and we ask you for your vote thank you
p716
aVthank you
p717
aVwhen governor romney s ask about it he said we gotta keep these sanction when he said well you re talk about do more what are you you re go to go to war is that what you want to do
p718
aVwe want to prevent war
p719
aVand the interest thing is how are they go to prevent war how are they go to prevent war if they say there s noth more that we that they say we should do than what we ve alreadi done number one
p720
aVand number two with regard to the abil of the unit state to take action militarili it is it is not in my purview to talk about classifi inform but we feel quit confid we could deal a serious blow to the iranian
p721
aVbut number two the iranian are the isra and the unit state our militari and intellig communiti are absolut the same exact place in term of how close how close the iranian are to get a nuclear weapon they are a good way away there is no differ between our view and their
p722
aVwhen my friend talk about fissil materi they have to take this high enrich uranium get it from 20 percent up then they have to be abl to have someth to put it in there is no weapon that the iranian have at this point both the isra and we know we ll know if they start the process of build a weapon
p723
aVso all this bluster i keep hear all this loos talk what are they talk about are you talk about to be more credibl what more can the presid do stand befor the unit nation tell the whole world direct communic to the ayatollah we will not let them acquir a nuclear weapon period unless he s talk about go to war
p724
aVmartha let s
p725
aVwhen you re look at a presid martha it seem to me that you should take a look at his most import respons that s care for the nation secur of the countri and the best way to do that is take a look at how he s handl the issu of the day
p726
aVlet s look at this from the view of the ayatollah what do they see they see this administr tri to water down sanction in congress for over two year they re move faster toward a nuclear weapon they re spin the centrifug faster
p727
aVthey see us say when we come into the administr when they re sworn in we need more space with our alli israel they see presid obama in new york citi the same day bibi netanyahu is and he instead of meet with him goe on a on a daili talk show
p728
aVthey see when we say that these option are on the tabl the secretari of defens walk them back
p729
aVthey are not chang their mind that s what we have to do is chang their mind so they stop pursu nuclear weapon and they re go faster
p730
aVwe can debat a time line we can debat the time line whether there s it s that short a time or longer i agre that it s probabl longer
p731
aVnumber two it s all about
p732
aVi don t want to go into classifi stuff but we both agre that to do this peac you ve got to get them to chang their mind they re not chang their mind and look at what this administr
p733
aVon iraq the presid said he would end the war governor romney said that was a tragic mistak we should have left 30 000 he end it governor romney said that was a tragic mistak we should have left 30 000 troop there
p734
aVlet me tell you what the ayatollah see
p735
aVyou have to have credibl
p736
aVthe ayatollah see his economi be crippl the ayatollah see that there are 50 percent fewer export of oil he see the currenc go into the tank he see the economi go into freefal and he see the world for the first time total unit in opposit to him get a nuclear weapon
p737
aVnow with regard to bibi who s been my friend 39 year the presid has met with bibi a dozen time he s spoken to bibi netanyahu as much as he s spoken to anybodi the idea that we re not i was in a just befor he went to the u n i was in a confer call with the with the presid with him talk to bibi for well over an hour in in in stark relief and detail of what was go on
p738
aVthis is a bunch of stuff look here s the deal
p739
aVwell it mean it s simpli inaccur
p740
aVit s irish
p741
aVit it is
p742
aVwe irish call it malarkey
p743
aVwith regard to afghanistan he said he will end the war in 2014 governor romney said we should not set a date number one and number two with regard to 2014 it depend
p744
aVwe irish call it malarkey but last thing the secretari of defens has made it absolut clear we didn t walk anyth back we will not allow the iranian to get a nuclear weapon what bibi held up there was when they get to the point where they can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon they don t have a weapon to put it into
p745
aVlet s all calm down a littl bit here iran is more isol today than when we took offic it was on the ascend when we took offic it is total isol
p746
aVi don t know what world this guy s live in
p747
aVthank heaven we had these sanction in place it s in spite of their opposit
p748
aVoh god
p749
aVthey ve given 20 waiver to this sanction and all i have to point to are the result they re four year closer toward a nuclear weapon i think that case speak for itself
p750
aVby the way they
p751
aVyour question is one that s be ask by colleg kid all over this countri i was in pennsylvania with someon who had just graduat this was in philadelphia and she said i ve got my degre i can t find a job i ve got three part time job they re just bare enough to pay for my food and pay for an apart i can t begin to pay back my student loan
p752
aVif you re ask me a question i m go to answer it
p753
aVthat wasn t a question
p754
aVokay go ahead
p755
aVthat was a statement i don t think the american peopl believ that i will fight for oil coal and natur gas and the proof of whether a strategi is work or not is what the price is that you re pay at the pump if you re pay less than you paid a year or 2 ago whi then the strategi is work but you re pay more
p756
aVwhen the presid took offic the price of gasolin here in nassau counti was about a buck eighti six a gallon now it s 4 buck a gallon the price of electr is up if the presid s energi polici are work you re go to see the cost of energi come down
p757
aVi will fight to creat more energi in this countri to get america energi secur and part of that is bring in a pipelin of oil from canada take advantag of the oil and coal we have here drill offshor in alaska drill offshor in virginia where the peopl want it
p758
aVthose thing will get us the energi we need
p759
aVso what we have to do is two thing we have to make sure that we make it easier for kid to afford colleg and also make sure that when they get out of colleg there s a job when i was governor of massachusett to get a high school degre you had to pass an exam if you graduat in the top quarter of your class we gave you a john and abigail adam scholarship 4 year tuition free to the colleg of your choic in massachusett it s a public institut
p760
aVwell think about what the governor just said he said when i took offic the price of gasolin was 1 80 1 86 whi is that becaus the economi was on the verg of collaps becaus we were about to go through the worst recess sinc the great depress as a consequ of some of the same polici that governor romney is now promot
p761
aVand i intend to win it as presid of the unit state
p762
aVno he got the first
p763
aVi want to make sure we keep our pell grant program grow we re also go to have our loan program so that peopl are abl to afford school but the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school and what s happen over the last 4 year has been veri veri hard for america s young peopl
p764
aVhe actual got the first question so i get the last question last answer on that one
p765
aVactual
p766
aVcandi i don t have a polici of stop wind job in iowa and they re not phantom job they re real job
p767
aVi appreci wind job in iowa and across our countri i appreci the job in coal and oil and gas i m go to make sure
p768
aVthat take advantag of our energi resourc will bring back manufactur to america we re go to get through a veri aggress energi polici 3 million more job in this countri it s critic to our futur
p769
aVcandi it s okay i m use to be interrupt
p770
aVi want you to be abl to get a job i know what it take to get this economi go with half of colleg kid graduat this year without a colleg excus me without a job and without a colleg level job that s just unaccept and likewis you got more and more debt on your back so more debt and less job i m go to chang that i know what it take to creat good job again i know what it take to make sure that you have the kind of opportun you deserv
p771
aVwe
p772
aVhi mari
p773
aVyou re do great
p774
aVthank you veri much and let me tell you you re absolut right about part of that which is i want to bring the rate down i want to simplifi the tax code and i want to get middl incom taxpay to have lower tax and the reason i want middl incom taxpay to have lower tax is becaus middl incom taxpay have been buri over the past 4 year
p775
aVyou ve seen as middl incom peopl in this countri incom go down 4 300 a famili even as gasolin price have gone up 2 000 health insur premium up 2 500 food price up util price up the middl incom famili in america have been crush over the last 4 year so i want to get some relief to middl incom famili that s part one
p776
aVand kid across this countri are go to recogn we re bring back an economi it s not go to be like the last 4 year the middl class has been crush over the last 4 year and job have been too scarc i know what it take to bring them back and i m go to do that and make sure when you graduat when do you graduat
p777
aVnow how about deduct becaus i m go to bring rate down across the board for everybodi but i m go to limit deduct and exempt and credit particular for peopl at the high end becaus i am not go to have peopl at the high end pay less than they re pay now
p778
aVthe top 5 percent of the taxpay will continu to pay 60 percent of the incom tax the nation collect so that will stay the same
p779
aVmiddl incom peopl are go to get a tax break and so in term of bring down deduct one way of do that would be to say everybodi get i ll pick a number 25 000 of deduct and credit and you can decid which one to use your home mortgag interest deduct chariti child tax credit and so forth you can use those as part of fill in that bucket if you will of deduct but your rate come down and the burden also come down on you for one more reason and that is everi middl incom taxpay no longer will pay ani tax on interest dividend or capit gain no tax on your save
p780
aVthat make life a lot easier if you re get interest from a bank if you re get a statement from a mutual fund or ani other kind of invest you have you don t have to worri about file tax on that becaus there will be no tax for anybodi make 200 000 a year and less on your interest dividend and capit gain
p781
aVwhi am i lower tax on the middl class becaus under the last 4 year they ve been buri and i want to help peopl in the middl class and i will not i will not under ani circumst reduc the share that s be paid by the highest incom taxpay and i will not under ani circumst increas tax on the middl class
p782
aVthe presid s spend the presid s borrow will caus this nation to have to rais tax on the american peopl not just at the high end a recent studi has shown that peopl in the middl class will see 4 000 a year higher tax as a result of the spend and borrow of this administr i will not let that happen i ll get us on track to a balanc budget and i m go to reduc the tax burden on middl incom famili and what s that go to do it s go to help those famili and it s go to creat incent to start grow job again in this countri
p783
aVthank you
p784
aVmy philosophi on tax has been simpl and that is i want to give middl class famili and folk who are strive to get into the middl class some relief becaus they have been hit hard over the last decad over the last 15 over the last 20 year
p785
aVso 4 year ago i stood on a stage just like this one actual it was a town hall and i said i would cut tax for middl class famili and that s what i ve done by 3 600 i said i would cut tax for small busi who are the driver and engin of growth and we ve cut them 18 time and i want to continu those tax cut for middl class famili and for small busi
p786
aVbut what i ve also said is if we re serious about reduc the deficit if this is genuin a moral oblig to the next generat then in addit to some tough spend cut we ve also got to make sure that the wealthi do a littl bit more
p787
aVso what i ve said is your first 250 000 worth of incom no chang and that mean 98 percent of american famili 97 percent of small busi they will not see a tax increas i m readi to sign that bill right now the onli reason it s not happen is becaus governor romney s alli in congress have held the 98 percent hostag becaus they want tax break for the top 2 percent
p788
aVbut what i ve also said is for abov 250 000 we can go back to the tax rate we had when bill clinton was presid we creat 23 million new job that s part of what took us from deficit to surplus it will be good for our economi and it will be good for job creation
p789
aVnow governor romney has a differ philosophi he was on 60 minut just 2 week ago and he was ask is it fair for somebodi like you make 20 million a year to pay a lower tax rate than a nurs or bus driver somebodi make 50 000 a year and he said yes i think that s fair not onli that he said i think that s what grow the economi
p790
aVwell i fundament disagre with that i think what grow the economi is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kid go to colleg i think that grow the economi i think what grow the economi is when we make sure small busi are get a tax credit for hire veteran who fought for our countri that grow our economi
p791
aVso we just have a differ theori and when governor romney stand here after a year of campaign when dure a republican primari he stood on stage and said i m go to give tax cut he didn t say tax rate cut he said tax cut to everybodi includ the top 1 percent you should believ him becaus that s been his histori and that s exact the kind of top down econom that is not go to work if we want a strong middl class and an economi that s thrive for everybodi
p792
aVyou re absolut right you heard what i said about my tax plan the top 5 percent will continu to pay 60 percent as they do today i m not look to cut tax for wealthi peopl i am look to cut tax for middl incom peopl
p793
aV2014 when you come out in 2014 i presum i m go to be presid i m go to make sure you get a job thank jeremi
p794
aVand whi do i want to bring rate down and at the same time lower exempt and deduct particular for peopl at the high end becaus if you bring rate down it make it easier for small busi to keep more of their capit and hire peopl and for me this is about job i want to get america s economi go again fifti four percent of america s worker work in busi that are tax as individu so when you bring those rate down those small busi are abl to keep more money and hire more peopl
p795
aVfor me i look at what s happen in the last 4 year and say this has been a disappoint we can do better than this we don t have to settl for how mani month 43 month with unemploy abov 8 percent 23 million american struggl to find a good job right now there are 3 million more women live in poverti today than when the presid took offic we don t have to live like this
p796
aVwe can get this economi go again my five point plan doe it energi independ for north america in 5 year open up more trade particular in latin america crack down on china when they cheat get us to a balanc budget fix our train program for our worker and final champion small busi
p797
aVi want to help small busi grow and thrive i know how to make that happen i spent my life in the privat sector i know whi job come and whi they go and they re go now becaus of the polici of this administr
p798
aVno it s not settl look the cost of lower rate for everybodi across the board 20 percent along with what he also want to do in term of elimin the estat tax along what he want to do in term of corpor chang in the tax code it cost about 5 trillion
p799
aVgovernor romney then also want to spend 2 trillion on addit militari program even though the militari is not ask for them that s 7 trillion he also want to continu the bush tax cut for the wealthiest american that s anoth trillion dollar that s 8 trillion
p800
aVnow what he say is he s go to make sure that this doesn t add to the deficit and he s go to cut middl class tax but when he s ask how are you go to do it which deduct which loophol are you go to close he can t tell you the fact that he onli has to pay 14 percent on his tax when a lot of you are pay much higher he s alreadi taken that off the board capit gain are go to continu to be at a low rate so we re not go to get money that way
p801
aVwe haven t heard from the governor ani specif beyond big bird and elimin fund for plan parenthood in term of how he pay for that
p802
aVnow governor romney was a veri success investor if somebodi came to you governor with a plan that said here i want to spend 7 or 8 trillion and then we re go to pay for it but we can t tell you until mayb after the elect how we re go to do it you wouldn t have taken such a sketchi deal
p803
aVand neither should you the american peopl becaus the math doesn t add up and what s at stake here is one of two thing either candi this blow up the deficit becaus keep in mind this is just to pay for the addit spend that he s talk about 7 8 trillion that s befor we even get to the deficit we alreadi have
p804
aVor altern it s got to be paid for not onli by close deduct for wealthi individu that will pay for about 4 percent reduct in tax rate you re go to be pay for it you ll lose some deduct and you can t buy this sale pitch nobodi who s look at it that s serious actual believ it add up
p805
aVwell catherin this is a great question and i was rais by a singl mom who had to put herself through school while look after two kid and she work hard everi day and made a lot of sacrific to make sure we got everyth we need
p806
aVmy grandmoth she start off as a secretari in a bank she never got a colleg educ even though she was smart as a whip and she work her way up to becom a vice presid at a local bank but she hit the glass ceil she train peopl who would end up becom her boss dure the cours of her career she didn t complain that s not what you did in that generat
p807
aVand this is one of the reason whi one of the first the first bill i sign was someth call the lilli ledbett bill and this is name after this amaz woman who had been do the same job as a man for year found out that she was get paid less and the suprem court said that she couldn t bring suit becaus she should have found out about it earlier when she had no way of find out about it so we fix that
p808
aVand that s an exampl of the kind of advocaci that we need becaus women are increas the breadwinn in the famili this is not just a women s issu this is a famili issu this is a middl class issu and that s whi we ve got to fight for it
p809
aVit also mean that we ve got to make sure that young peopl like yourself are abl to afford a colleg educ earlier governor romney talk about he want to make pell grant and other educ access for young peopl well the truth of the matter is is that that s exact what we ve done we ve expand pell grant for million of peopl includ million of young women all across the countri we did it by take 60 billion that was go to bank and lender as middlemen for the student loan program and we said let s just cut out the middleman let s give the money direct to student and as a consequ we ve seen million of young peopl be abl to afford colleg and that s go to make sure that young women are go to be abl to compet in that marketplac
p810
aVyes you bet
p811
aVbut we ve got to enforc the law which is what we are do and we ve also got to make sure that in everi walk of life we do not toler discrimin that s been one of the hallmark of my administr i m go to continu to push on this issu for the next 4 year
p812
aVthank you an import topic and one which i learn a great deal about particular as i was serv as governor of my state becaus i had the chanc to pull togeth a cabinet and all the applic seem to be men and i went to my staff and i said how come all the peopl for these job are all men and they said well these are the peopl that have the qualif and i said well gosh can t we find some women that are also qualifi and so we took a concert effort to go out and find women who had background that could be qualifi to becom member of our cabinet i went to a number of women s group and said can you help us find folk and they brought us whole binder full of women
p813
aVi was proud of the fact that after i staf my cabinet and my senior staff that the univers of new york in albani did a survey of all 50 state and conclud that mine had more women in senior leadership posit than ani other state in america
p814
aVnow one of the reason i was abl to get so mani good women to be part of that team was becaus of our recruit effort but number two becaus i recogn that if you re go to have women in the workforc that sometim they need to be more flexibl my chief of staff for instanc had two kid that were still in school she said i can t be here until 7 or 8 o clock at night i need to be abl to get home at 5 o clock so i can be there for make dinner for my kid and be with them when they get home from school so we said fine let s have a flexibl schedul so you can have hour that work for you
p815
aVwe re go to have to have employ in the new economi in the economi i m go to bring to play that are go to be so anxious to get good worker they re go to be anxious to hire women
p816
aVin the last 4 year women have lost 580 000 job that s the net of what s happen in the last 4 year we re still down 580 000 job i mention 3 million women more now in poverti than 4 year ago
p817
aVwhat we can do to help young women and women of all age is to have a strong economi so strong that employ are look to find good employe and bring them into their workforc and adapt to a flexibl work schedul that give women the opportun that they would otherwis not be abl to afford
p818
aVthis is what i ve done it s what i look forward to do and i know what it take to make an economi work and i know what a work economi look like and an economi with 7 8 percent unemploy is not a real strong economi an economi that has 23 million peopl look for work is not a strong economi an economi with 50 percent of kid graduat from colleg that can t find a job or a colleg level job that s not what we have to have
p819
aVi m go to help women in america get good work by get a stronger economi and by support women in the workforc
p820
aVcatherin i just want to point out that when governor romney s campaign was ask about the lilli ledbett bill whether he support it he said i ll get back to you and that s not the kind of advocaci that women need in ani economi
p821
aVnow there are some other issu that have a bear on how women succeed in the workplac for exampl their health care a major differ in this campaign is that governor romney feel comfort have politician in washington decid the health care choic that women are make i think that s a mistak
p822
aVin my health care bill i said insur compani need to provid contracept coverag to everybodi who s insur becaus this is not just a health issu it s an econom issu for women it make a differ this is money out of that famili s pocket
p823
aVgovernor romney not onli oppos it he suggest that in fact employ should be abl to make the decis as to whether or not a woman get contracept through her insur coverag that s not the kind of advocaci that women need
p824
aVwhen governor romney say that we should elimin fund for plan parenthood there are million of women all across the countri who reli on plan parenthood for not just contracept care they reli on it for mammogram for cervic cancer screen that s a pocketbook issu for women and famili all across the countri and it make a differ in term of how well and effect women are abl to work
p825
aVwhen we talk about child care and the credit that we re provid that make a differ in term of whether they can go out there and earn a live for their famili
p826
aVthese are not just women s issu these are famili issu these are econom issu and one of the thing that make us grow as an economi is when everybodi particip and women are get the same fair deal as men are
p827
aVand i ve got two daughter and i want to make sure that they have the same opportun that anybodi s son have that s a part of what i m fight for as presid of the unit state
p828
aVgreat thank you and i appreci that question i just want to make sure that i think i was suppos to get that last answer but i want to point out that i don t believ
p829
aVi don t think so candi i want to make sure our timekeep are work here
p830
aVthe time
p831
aVjeremi first of all your futur is bright and the fact that you re make an invest in higher educ is critic not just to you but to the entir nation now the most import thing we can do is to make sure that we are creat job in this countri but not just job good pay job one that can support a famili
p832
aVall right
p833
aVi d just note that i don t believ that bureaucrat in washington should tell someon whether they can use contracept or not and i don t believ employ should tell someon whether they could have contracept care or not everi woman in america should have access to contracept and the presid s statement of my polici is complet and total wrong
p834
aVgovernor that s not true
p835
aVlet me come back and answer your question presid bush and i are differ peopl and these are differ time and that s whi my five point plan is so differ than what he would have done
p836
aVi mean for instanc we can now by virtu of new technolog actual get all the energi we need in north america without have to go to the arab or the venezuelan or anyon els that wasn t true in his time that s whi my polici start with a veri robust polici to get all that energi in north america becom energi secur
p837
aVnumber two trade i ll crack down on china presid bush didn t i m also go to dramat expand trade in latin america it s been grow about 12 percent per year over a long period of time i want to add more free trade agreement so we ll have more trade
p838
aVnumber three i m go to get us to a balanc budget presid bush didn t presid obama was right he said that that was outrag to have deficit as high as half a trillion dollar under the bush year he was right but then he put in place deficit twice that size for everi one of his 4 year and his forecast for the next 4 year is more deficit almost that larg so that s the next area i m differ than presid bush
p839
aVand then let s take the last one champion small busi our parti has been focus on big busi too long i came through small busi i understand how hard it is to start a small busi that s whi everyth i ll do is design to help small busi grow and add job i want to keep their tax down on small busi i want regul to see their job as encourag small enterpris not crush it
p840
aVand the thing i find most troubl about obamacar well it s a long list but one of the thing i find most troubl is that when you go out and talk to small busi and ask them what they think about it they tell you it keep them from hire more peopl
p841
aVand what i want to do is build on the 5 million job that we ve creat over the last 30 month in the privat sector alon and there are a bunch of thing that we can do to make sure your futur is bright
p842
aVmy prioriti is job i know how to make that happen and presid bush had a veri differ path for a veri differ time my path is design in get small busi to grow and hire peopl
p843
aVwell first of all i think it s import to tell you that we did come in dure some tough time we were lose 800 000 job a month when i start but we have been dig our way out of polici that were misplac and focus on the top do veri well and middl class folk not do well and we ve seen 30 consecut 31 consecut month of job growth 5 2 million new job creat and the plan that i talk about will creat even more
p844
aVbut when governor romney say that he has a veri differ econom plan the centerpiec of his econom plan are tax cut that s what took us from surplus to deficit when he talk about get tough on china keep in mind that governor romney invest in compani that were pioneer of outsourc to china and is current invest in countri in compani that are build surveil equip for china to spi on it own folk
p845
aVthat s governor you re the last person who is go to get tough on china
p846
aVand what we ve done when it come to trade is not onli sign three trade deal to open up new market but we ve also set up a task forc for trade that goe after anybodi who is take advantag of american worker or busi and not creat a level play field we ve brought twice as mani case against unfair trade practic than the previous administr and we ve won everi singl one that s been decid
p847
aVwhen i said that we had to make sure that china was not flood our domest market with cheap tire governor romney said i was be protectionist that it wouldn t be help to american worker well in fact we save a thousand job and that s the kind of tough trade action that are requir
p848
aVbut the last point i want to make is this there are some thing where governor romney is differ from georg bush georg bush didn t propos turn medicar into a voucher georg bush embrac comprehens immigr reform he didn t call for self deport georg bush never suggest that we elimin fund for plan parenthood
p849
aVnumber one i want to build manufactur job in this countri again when governor romney said we should let detroit go bankrupt i said we re go to bet on american worker and the american auto industri and it s come surg back i want to do that in industri not just in detroit but all across the countri and that mean we chang our tax code so we re give incent to compani that are invest here in the unit state and creat job here it also mean we re help them and small busi to export all around the world to new market
p850
aVso there are differ between governor romney and georg bush but they re not on econom polici in some way he s gone to a more extrem place when it come to social polici and i think that s a mistak that s not how we re go to move our economi forward
p851
aVwell we ve gone through a tough 4 year there s no doubt about it but 4 year ago i told the american peopl and i told you i would cut tax for middl class famili and i did i told you i d cut tax for small busi and i have i said that i d end the war in iraq and i did i said we d refocus attent on those who actual attack us on 9 11 and we have gone after al qaida s leadership like never befor and usama bin laden is dead
p852
aVi said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insur compani can t jerk you around and if you don t have health insur that you d have a chanc to get afford insur and i have
p853
aVi commit that i would rein in the excess of wall street and we pass the toughest wall street reform sinc the 1930s
p854
aVwe ve creat 5 million job gone from 800 000 job a month be lost and we are make progress we save an auto industri that was on the brink of collaps
p855
aVnow doe that mean you re not struggl absolut not a lot of us are and that s whi the plan that i ve put forward for manufactur and educ and reduc our deficit in a sensibl way use the save from end war to rebuild america and put peopl back to work make sure that we are control our own energi but not just the energi of today but also the energi of the futur all those thing will make a differ
p856
aVso the point is the commit i ve made i ve kept and those that i haven t been abl to keep it s not for lack of tri and we re go to get it done in a second term but you should pay attent to this campaign becaus governor romney has made some commit as well and i suspect he ll keep those too when member of the republican congress say we re go to sign a no tax pledg so that we don t ask a dime from millionair and billionair to reduc our deficit so we can still invest in educ and help kid go to colleg he said me too
p857
aVnumber two we ve got to make sure that we have the best educ system in the world and the fact that you re go to colleg is great but i want everybodi to get a great educ and we ve work hard to make sure that student loan are avail for folk like you but i also want to make sure that communiti colleg are offer slot for worker to get retrain for the job that are out there right now and the job of the futur
p858
aVwhen they said we re go to cut plan parenthood fund he said me too when they said we re go to repeal obamacar the first thing i m go to do despit the fact that it s the same health care plan that he pass in massachusett and is work well he said me too
p859
aVthat is not the kind of leadership that you need but you should expect that those are promis he s go to keep
p860
aVand the choic in this elect is go to be whose promis are go to be more like to help you in your life make sure your kid can go to colleg make sure that you are get a good pay job make sure that medicar and social secur will be there for you
p861
aVi think you know better i think you know that these last 4 year haven t been so good as the presid just describ and that you don t feel like you re confid that the next 4 year are go to be much better either i can tell you that if you were to elect presid obama you know what you re go to get you re go to get a repeat of the last 4 year we just can t afford 4 more year like the last 4 year
p862
aVhe said that by now we d have unemploy at 5 4 percent the differ between where it is and 5 4 percent is 9 million american without work i wasn t the one that said 5 4 percent this was the presid s plan didn t get there
p863
aVhe said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform medicar and social secur becaus he point out they re on the road to bankruptci he would reform them he d get that done he hasn t even made a propos on either one he said in his first year he d put out an immigr plan that would deal with our immigr challeng didn t even file it
p864
aVnumber three we ve got to control our own energi not onli oil and natur gas which we ve been invest in but also we ve got to make sure we re build the energi sourc of the futur not just think about next year but 10 year from now 20 year from now that s whi we ve invest in solar and wind and biofuel energi effici car
p865
aVthis is a presid who has not been abl to do what he said he d do he said that he d cut in half the deficit he hasn t done that either in fact he doubl it he said that by now middl incom famili would have a reduct in their health insur premium by 2 500 a year it s gone up by 2 500 a year and if obamacar is pass or implement it s alreadi been pass if it s implement fulli it will be anoth 2 500 on top
p866
aVthe middl class is get crush under the polici of a presid who has not understood what it take to get the economi work again he keep say look i ve creat 5 million job that s after lose 5 million job the entir record is such that the unemploy has not been reduc in this countri the unemploy the number of peopl who are still look for work is still 23 million american there are more peopl in poverti one out of six peopl in poverti
p867
aVhow about food stamp when he took offic 32 million peopl were on food stamp today 47 million peopl are on food stamp how about the growth of the economi it s grow more slowli this year than last year and more slowli last year than the year befor
p868
aVthe presid want to do well i understand but the polici he s put in place from obamacar to dodd frank to his tax polici to his regulatori polici these polici combin have not let this economi take off and grow like it could have you might say well you got an exampl of when it work better yes in the reagan recess where unemploy hit 10 8 percent between that period the end of that recess and the equival period of time to today ronald reagan s recoveri creat twice as mani job as this presid s recoveri
p869
aVfive million job doesn t even keep up with our popul growth and the onli reason the unemploy rate seem a littl lower today is becaus of all the peopl that have drop out of the workforc
p870
aVthe presid has tri but his polici haven t work he s great as a speaker and describ his plan and his vision that s wonder except we have a record to look at and that record show he just hasn t been abl to cut the deficit to put in place reform for medicar and social secur to preserv them to get us the rise incom we need median incom down 4 300 a famili and 23 million american out of work that s what this elect is about it s about who can get the middl class in this countri a bright and prosper futur and assur our kid the kind of hope and optim they deserv
p871
aVthis is for governor romney
p872
aVis it lorena
p873
aVwe ve got to reduc our deficit but we ve got to do it in a balanc way ask the wealthi to pay a littl bit more along with cut so that we can invest in educ like your and let s take the money that we ve been spend on war over the last decad to rebuild america road bridg school we do those thing not onli is your futur go to be bright but america s futur is go to be bright as well
p874
aVlorrain
p875
aVgood thank
p876
aVthank you lorrain did i get that right good thank you for question and let me step back and tell you what i d like to do with our immigr polici broad and includ an answer to your question
p877
aVfirst of all this is a nation of immigr we welcom peopl come to this countri as immigr my dad was born in mexico of american parent ann s dad was born in wale and is a first generat american we welcom legal immigr into this countri
p878
aVi want our legal system to work better i want it to be streamlin i want it to be clearer i don t think you have to shouldn t have to hire a lawyer to figur out how to get into this countri legal i also think that we should give visa to peopl green card rather to peopl who graduat with skill that we need peopl around the world with accredit degre in scienc and math get a green card stapl to their diploma come to the u s of a we should make sure that our legal system work
p879
aVnumber two we re go to have to stop illeg immigr there are 4 million peopl who are wait in line to get here legal those who ve come here illeg take their place so i will not grant amnesti to those who ve come here illeg what i will do is i ll put in place an employ verif system and make sure that employ that hire peopl who have come here illeg are sanction for do so i won t put in place magnet for peopl come here illeg so for instanc i would not give driver s licens to those that have come here illeg as the presid would
p880
aVthe kid of those that came here illeg those kid i think should have a pathway to becom a perman resid of the unit state and militari servic for instanc is one way they would have that kind of pathway to becom a perman resid
p881
aVnow when the presid ran for offic he said that he d put in place in his first year a piec of legisl he d file a bill in his first year that would reform our immigr system protect legal immigr stop illeg immigr he didn t do it he had a democrat hous and democrat senat supermajor in both hous whi did he fail to even promot legisl that would have provid an answer for those that want to come here legal and for those that are here illeg today that s a question i think the presid will have a chanc to answer to answer right now
p882
aVgood i look forward to it was it lorena lorrain we are a nation of immigr i mean we re just a few mile away from elli island we all understand what this countri has becom becaus talent from all around the world want to come here peopl who are will to take risk peopl who want to build on their dream and make sure their kid have even bigger dream than they have
p883
aVbut we re also a nation of law so what i ve said is we need to fix a broken immigr system and i ve done everyth that i can on my own and sought cooper from congress to make sure that we fix the system
p884
aVfirst thing we did was to streamlin the legal immigr system to reduc the backlog make it easier simpler and cheaper for peopl who are wait in line obey the law to make sure that they can come here and contribut to our countri and that s good for our econom growth they ll start new busi they ll make thing happen that creat job here in the unit state
p885
aVnumber two we do have to deal with our border so we ve put more border patrol on than ani time in histori and the flow of undocu worker across the border is actual lower than it s been in 40 year
p886
aVwhat i ve also said is if we re go to go after folk who are here illeg we should do it smart and go after folk who are crimin gangbang peopl who are hurt the communiti not after student not after folk who are here just becaus they re tri to figur out how to feed their famili and that s what we ve done
p887
aVand what i ve also said is for young peopl who come here brought here oftentim by their parent have gone to school here pledg allegi to the flag think of this as their countri understand themselv as american in everi way except have paper then we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship and that s what i ve done administr
p888
aVnow governor romney just said that he want to help those young peopl too but dure the republican primari he said i will veto the dream act that would allow these young peopl to have access his main strategi dure the republican primari was to say we re go to encourag self deport make life so miser on folk that they ll leav
p889
aVhe call the arizona law a model for the nation part of the arizona law said that law enforc offic could stop folk becaus they suspect mayb they look like they might be undocu worker and check their paper and you know what if my daughter or your look to somebodi like they re not a citizen i don t want to empow somebodi like that
p890
aVso we can fix this system in a comprehens way and when governor romney say the challeng is well obama didn t tri that s not true i sat down with democrat and republican at the begin of my term and i said let s fix this system includ senat previous who had support it on the republican side but it s veri hard for republican in congress to support comprehens immigr reform if their standard bearer has said that this is not someth i m interest in support
p891
aVlet s
p892
aVno let me go back and speak to the point that the presid made and let s get them correct i did not say that the arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect i said that the e verifi portion of the arizona law which is the portion of the law which say that employ could be abl to determin whether someon is here illeg or not illeg that that was a model for the nation that s number one
p893
aVnumber two i ask the presid a question i think hispan and immigr all over the nation have ask he was ask this on univis the other day whi when you said you d file legisl in your first year didn t you do it and he didn t answer he doesn t answer that question he said the standard bearer wasn t for it i m glad you thought i was a standard bearer 4 year ago but i wasn t four year ago you said in your first year you would file legisl in his first year i was just get lick my wound from have been beaten by john mccain all right i was not the standard bearer my view is that this presid should have honor his promis to do as he said
p894
aVnow let me mention one other thing and that is self deport say let peopl make their own choic what i was say is we re not go to round up 12 million peopl undocu illeg and take them out of the nation instead let peopl make their own choic and if they find that they can t get the benefit here that they want and they can t find the job they want then they ll make a decis to go a place where they have better opportun
p895
aVbut i m not in favor of round up peopl and take them out of this countri i am in favor as the presid has said and i agre with him which is that if peopl have commit crime we ve got to get them out of this countri
p896
aVwell what you re see in this countri is 23 million peopl struggl to find a job and a lot of them as you say candi have been out of work for a long long long time the presid s polici have been exercis over the last 4 year and they haven t put american back to work we have fewer peopl work today than we had when the presid took offic if the the unemploy rate was 7 8 percent when he took offic it s 7 8 percent now but if you calcul that unemploy rate take back the peopl who drop out of the workforc it would be 10 7 percent
p897
aVlet me mention someth els the presid said it was a moment ago and i didn t get a chanc to when he was describ chines invest and so forth
p898
aVcandi hold on a second at some point we ll pick that up
p899
aVmr presid i m still speak
p900
aVmr presid whi don t you let me finish
p901
aVgovernor romney i m use to be interrupt i need to make sure
p902
aVi m go to continu i m go to continu the presid made
p903
aVyes just go to make a point ani invest i have over the last 8 year have been manag by a blind trust and i understand they do includ invest outsid the unit state includ in chines compani
p904
aVmr presid have you look at your pension
p905
aVwe have not made the progress we need to make to put peopl back to work that s whi i put out a five point plan that get america 12 million new job in 4 year and rise take home pay it s go to help jeremi get a job when he come out of school it s go to help peopl across the countri that are unemploy right now
p906
aVcandi
p907
aVhave you look at your pension
p908
aVcandi i ve got to say i mean
p909
aVmr presid have you look at your pension
p910
aVyou know i don t look at my pension it s not as big as your so it doesn t take as long
p911
aVlet me give you some advic
p912
aVi don t check it that often
p913
aVlook at your pension you also have invest in chines compani you also have invest outsid the unit state you also have invest through a cayman s trust
p914
aVall right candi we re a littl off topic here
p915
aVand one thing that the presid said which i want to make sure that we understand he said that i said we should take detroit bankrupt and that s right my plan was to have the compani go through bankruptci like 7 eleven did and maci s and continent airlin and come out stronger and i know he keep say you want to take detroit bankrupt well the presid took detroit bankrupt you took general motor bankrupt you took chrysler bankrupt so when you say that i want to take the auto industri bankrupt you actual did
p916
aVcome on i thought we were talk about immigr
p917
aVi do want to make sure
p918
aVi do want to make sure that we just understand someth governor romney say he wasn t refer to arizona as a model for the nation his top advis on immigr is the guy who design the arizona law the entireti of it not e verifi the whole thing that s his polici and it s a bad polici and it won t help us grow
p919
aVlook when we think about immigr we have to understand there are folk all around the world who still see america as the land of promis and they provid us energi and they provid us innov and they start compani like intel and googl and we want to encourag that
p920
aVnow we ve got to make sure that we do it in a smart way in a comprehens way and we make the legal system better but when we make this into a divis polit issu and when we don t have bipartisan support i can deliv governor a whole bunch of democrat to get comprehens immigr reform done and we can t
p921
aVi ll get it done
p922
aVand i think it s import to know that that was a process that was necessari to get those compani back on their feet so they could start hire more peopl that was precis what i recommend and ultim what happen
p923
aVwe can t
p924
aVi ll get it done the first year
p925
aVwe can t
p926
aVand it s time for them to get serious on it
p927
aVthis use to be a bipartisan issu
p928
aVi m here
p929
aVokay hi kara
p930
aVi m sorri what s your name
p931
aVgreat to see you here
p932
aVwell let me first of all talk about our diplomat becaus they serv all around the world and do an incred job in a veri danger situat and these aren t just repres of the unit state they re my repres i send them there oftentim into harm s way i know these folk and i know their famili so nobodi is more concern about their safeti and secur than i am
p933
aVso as soon as we found out that the benghazi consul was be overrun i was on the phone with my nation secur team and i gave them three instruct number one beef up our secur and procedur not just in libya but in everi embassi and consul in the region number two investig exact what happen regardless of where the fact lead us to make sure that folk are held account and it doesn t happen again and number three we are go to find out who did this and we are go to hunt them down becaus one of the thing that i ve said throughout my presid is when folk mess with american we go after them
p934
aVnow governor romney had a veri differ respons while we were still deal with our diplomat be threaten governor romney put out a press releas tri to make polit point and that s not how a command in chief oper you don t turn nation secur into a polit issu certain not right when it s happen
p935
aVand peopl not everybodi agre with some of the decis i ve made but when it come to our nation secur i mean what i say i said i d end the war in libya in iraq and i did i said that we d go after al qaida and bin laden we have i said we d transit out of afghanistan and start make sure that afghan are respons for their own secur that s what i m do
p936
aVand when it come to this issu when i say that we are go to find out exact what happen everybodi will be held account and i am ultim respons for what s take place there becaus these are my folk and i m the one who has to greet those coffin when they come home you know that i mean what i say
p937
aVthank you kerri for your question it s an import one and i think the presid just said correct that the buck doe stop at his desk and he take respons for that for the failur in provid those secur resourc and those terribl thing may well happen from time to time i feel veri deepli sympathet for the famili of those who lost love one and today there s a memori servic for one of those that was lost in this tragedi we think of their famili and care for them deepli
p938
aVthere were other issu associ with this tragedi there were mani day that pass befor we knew whether this was a spontan demonstr or actual whether it was a terrorist attack and there was no demonstr involv it was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the american peopl
p939
aVwhether there was some mislead or instead whether we just didn t know what happen i think you have to ask yourself whi didn t we know 5 day later when the ambassador to the unit nation went on tv to say that this was a demonstr how could we have not known
p940
aVbut i find more troubl than this that on the day follow the assassin of the unit state ambassador the first time that s happen sinc 1979 when we have four american kill there when appar we didn t know what happen that the presid the day after that happen fli to las vega for a polit fundrais then the next day to colorado for anoth event anoth polit event i think these action taken by a presid and a leader have symbol signific and perhap even materi signific in that you d hope that dure that time we could call in the peopl who were actual eyewit we ve read their account now about what happen it was veri clear this was not a demonstr this was an attack by terrorist
p941
aVand this call into question the presid s whole polici in the middl east look what s happen in syria in egypt now in libya consid the distanc between ourselv and israel the presid said that he was go to put daylight between us and israel we have iran 4 year closer to a nuclear bomb
p942
aVcandi what governor romney said just isn t true he want to take them into bankruptci without provid them ani way to stay open and we would have lost a million job and that don t take my word for it take the execut at gm and chrysler some of whom are republican may even support governor romney but they ll tell you his prescript wasn t go to work
p943
aVsyria syria is not just the tragedi of 30 000 civilian be kill by a militari but also a strateg signific player for america the presid s polici throughout the middl east began with an apolog tour and pursu a strategi of lead from behind and this strategi is unravel befor our veri eye
p944
aVsecretari clinton has done an extraordinari job but she work for me i m the presid and i m alway respons and that s whi nobodi is more interest in find out exact what happen than i do
p945
aVthe day after the attack governor i stood in the rose garden and i told the american peopl and the world that we are go to find out exact what happen that this was an act of terror and i also said that we re go to hunt down those who commit this crime and then a few day later i was there greet the casket come into andrew air forc base and griev with the famili
p946
aVand the suggest that anybodi in my team whether the secretari of state our u n ambassador anybodi on my team would play polit or mislead when we ve lost four of our own governor is offens that s not what we do that s not what i do as presid that s not what i do as command in chief
p947
aVyes i certain do i certain do i think it s interest the presid just said someth which is that on the day after the attack he went in the rose garden and said that this was an act of terror
p948
aVthat s what i said
p949
aVand governor romney say he s got a five point plan governor romney doesn t have a five point plan he has a one point plan and that plan is to make sure that folk at the top play by a differ set of rule that s been his philosophi in the privat sector that s been his philosophi as governor that s been his philosophi as a presidenti candid you can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rate than somebodi who make a lot less you can ship job oversea and get tax break for it you can invest in a compani bankrupt it lay off the worker strip away their pension and you still make money
p950
aVyou said in the rose garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror it was not a spontan demonstr
p951
aVpleas proceed
p952
aVis that what you re say
p953
aVpleas proceed governor
p954
aVi want to make sure we get that for the record becaus it took the presid 14 day befor he call the attack in benghazi an act of terror
p955
aVget the transcript
p956
aVcan you say that a littl louder candi
p957
aVthe administr indic that this was a reaction to a video and was a spontan reaction
p958
aVthat s exact the philosophi that we ve seen in place for the last decad that s what s been squeez middl class famili and we have fought back for 4 year to get out of that mess the last thing we need to do is to go back to the veri same polici that got us there
p959
aVit took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group and to suggest am i incorrect in that regard on sunday the your secretari
p960
aVcandi
p961
aVexcus me the ambassador to the unit nation went on the sunday televis show and spoke about how this was a spontan reaction
p962
aVcandi i m happi to have a longer convers about foreign polici
p963
aVokay i m happi to do that too
p964
aVi just want to make sure that
p965
aVwe re a nation that believ in the second amend and i believ in the second amend we ve got a long tradit of hunt and sportsmen and peopl who want to make sure they can protect themselv
p966
aVbut there have been too mani instanc dure the cours of my presid where i ve had to comfort famili who have lost somebodi most recent out in aurora just a coupl of week ago actual probabl about a month i saw a mother who i had met at the bedsid of her son who had been shot in that theater and her son had been shot through the head and we spent some time and we said a prayer and remark about 2 month later this young man and his mom show up and he look unbeliev good as new but there were a lot of famili who didn t have that good fortun and whose son or daughter or husband didn t surviv
p967
aVso my belief is that a we have to enforc the law we ve alreadi got make sure that we re keep gun out of the hand of crimin those who are mental ill we ve done a much better job in term of background check but we ve got more to do when it come to enforc
p968
aVbut i also share your belief that weapon that were design for soldier in war theater don t belong on our street and so what i m tri to do is to get a broader convers about how do we reduc the violenc general part of it is see if we can get an assault weapon ban reintroduc but part of it is also look at other sourc of the violenc becaus frank in my hometown of chicago there s an aw lot of violenc and they re not use ak 47s they re use cheap handgun
p969
aVand so what can we do to interven to make sure that young peopl have opportun that our school are work that if there s violenc on the street that work with faith group and law enforc we can catch it befor it get out of control
p970
aVand so what i want is a comprehens strategi part of it is see if we can get automat weapon that kill folk in amaz number out of the hand of crimin and the mental ill but part of it is also go deeper and see if we can get into these communiti and make sure we catch violent impuls befor they occur
p971
aVthat detroit answer
p972
aVyes i m not in favor of new piec of legisl on gun and take gun away or make certain gun illeg we of cours don t want to have automat weapon and that s alreadi illeg in this countri to have automat weapon
p973
aVwhat i believ is we have to do as the presid mention toward the end of his remark there which is to make enorm effort to enforc the gun law that we have and to chang the cultur of violenc we have and you ask how are we go to do that and there are a number of thing he mention good school i total agre we were abl to drive our school to be number one in the nation in my state and i believ if we do a better job in educ we ll give peopl the hope and opportun they deserv and perhap less violenc from that
p974
aVbut let me mention anoth thing and that is parent we need mom and dad help rais kid wherev possibl the benefit of have two parent in the home and that s not alway possibl a lot of great singl mom singl dad but gosh to tell our kid that befor they have babi they ought to think about get marri to someon that s a great idea becaus if there s a two parent famili the prospect of live in poverti goe down dramat the opportun that the child will be abl to achiev increas dramat so we can make chang in the way our cultur work to help bring peopl away from violenc and give them opportun and bring them in the american system
p975
aVthe greatest failur we ve had with regard to gun violenc in some respect is what is known as fast and furious which was a program under this administr and how it work exact i think we don t know precis but where thousand of automat and ak 47 type weapon were given to peopl that ultim gave them to drug lord they use those weapon against their own citizen and kill american with them and this was a program of the govern for what purpos it was put in place i can t imagin but it s one of the great tragedi relat to violenc in our societi which has occur dure this administr which i think the american peopl would like to understand fulli
p976
aVit s been investig to a degre but the administr has carri out execut privileg to prevent all the inform from come out i d like to understand who it was that did this what the idea was behind it whi it led to the violenc thousand of gun go to mexico
p977
aVcandi
p978
aVwell candi actual in my state the pro gun folk and the anti gun folk came togeth and put togeth a piec of legisl and it s refer to as an assault weapon ban but it had at the sign of the bill both the pro gun and the anti gun peopl came togeth becaus it provid opportun for both that both want there were hunt opportun for instanc that hadn t previous been avail and so forth so it was a mutual agre upon piec of legisl
p979
aVthat s what we need more of candi what we have right now in washington is a place that s gridlock
p980
aVcandi
p981
aVwe haven t had the leadership in washington to work at a bipartisan basi i was abl to do that in my state and bring these two togeth
p982
aVcandi
p983
aVfirst of all i think governor romney was for an assault weapon ban befor he was against it and he said that the reason he chang his mind was in part becaus he was seek the endors of the nation rifl associ so that s on the record
p984
aVthat detroit answer and the rest of the answer way off the mark
p985
aVbut i think that one area we agre on is the import of parent and the import of school becaus i do believ that if our young peopl have opportun then they re less like to engag in these kind of violent act we re not go to elimin everybodi who is mental disturb and we ve got to make sure that they don t get weapon but we can make a differ in term of ensur that everi young person in america regardless of where they come from what they look like have a chanc to succeed
p986
aVand candi we haven t had a chanc to talk about educ much but i think it is veri import to understand that the reform we ve put in place work with 46 governor around the countri are see school that are some of the one that are the toughest for kid start to succeed we re start to see gain in math and scienc
p987
aVwhen it come to communiti colleg we are set up program includ with nassau communiti colleg to retrain worker includ young peopl who may have drop out of school but now are get anoth chanc train them for the job that exist right now and in fact employ are look for skill worker and so we re match them up give them access to higher educ as i said we have made sure that million of young peopl are abl to get an educ that they weren t abl to get befor now
p988
aVbut
p989
aVjust one second
p990
aVbecaus this is import this is part of the choic in this elect when governor romney was ask whether teacher hire more teacher was import to grow our economi governor romney said that doesn t grow our economi when he was ask is was class size
p991
aVi understand
p992
aVbut this will make a differ in term of whether or not we can move this economi forward for these young peopl
p993
aVand reduc our violenc
p994
aVboy great question an import question becaus you re absolut right the place where we ve seen manufactur go has been china china is now the largest manufactur in the world use to be the unit state of america a lot of good peopl have lost job a half a million manufactur job have been lost in the last 4 year that s total over the last 4 year one of the reason for that is that peopl think it s more attract in some case to go offshor than to stay here we have made it less attract for enterpris to stay here than to go offshor from time to time
p995
aVwhat i will do as presid is make sure it s more attract to come to america again this is the way we re go to creat job in this countri it s not by trickl down govern say we re go to take more money from peopl and hire more govern worker rais more tax put in place more regul trickl down govern has never work here has never work anywher
p996
aVi want to make america the most attract place in the world for entrepreneur for small busi for big busi to invest and grow in america now we re go to have to make sure that as we trade with other nation that they play by the rule and china hasn t one of the reason or one of the way they don t play by the rule is artifici hold down the valu of their currenc becaus if they put their currenc down low that mean their price on their good are low and that make them advantag in the marketplac we lose sale and manufactur here in the u s make the same product can t compet
p997
aVchina has been a currenc manipul for year and year and year and the presid has a regular opportun to label them as a currenc manipul but refus to do so on day one i will label china a currenc manipul which will allow me as presid to be abl to put in place if necessari tariff where i believ that they are take unfair advantag of our manufactur
p998
aVso we re go to make sure that peopl we trade with around the world play by the rule but let me not just stop there don t forget what s key to bring back job here is not just find someon els to punish and i m go to be strict with peopl who we trade with to make sure they follow the law and play by the rule but it s also to make america the most attract place in the world for busi of all kind that s whi i want to bring down the tax rate on small employ big employ so they want to be here
p999
aVcanada s tax rate on compani is now 15 percent our is 35 percent so if you re start a busi where would you rather start it we have to be competit if we re go to creat more job here regul have quadrupl the rate of regul quadrupl under this presid i ve talk to small busi across the countri they say we feel like we re under attack from our own govern i want to make sure that regul see their job as encourag small busi not crush it and there s no question but that obamacar has been an extraordinari deterr to enterpris of all kind hire peopl
p1000
aVmy prioriti is make sure that we get more peopl hire if we have more peopl hire if we get back manufactur job if we get back all kind of job into this countri then you re go to see rise incom again the reason incom are down is becaus unemploy is so high i know what it take to get this to happen and my plan will do that and one part of it is to make sure that we keep china play by the rule thank you
p1001
aVwe need to creat job here and both governor romney and i agre actual that we should lower our corpor tax rate it s too high but there s a differ in term of how we would do it i want to close loophol that allow compani to deduct expens when they move to china that allow them to profit offshor and not have to get tax so they have tax advantag offshor all those chang in our tax code would make a differ
p1002
aVnow governor romney actual want to expand those tax break one of his big idea when it come to corpor tax reform would be to say if you invest oversea you make profit oversea you don t have to pay u s tax but of cours if you re a small busi or a mom and pop busi or a big busi start up here you ve got to pay even the reduc rate that governor romney is talk about and it s estim that that will creat 800 000 new job the problem is they ll be in china or india or germani that s not the way we re go to creat job here
p1003
aVthe way we re go to creat job here is not just to chang our tax code but also to doubl our export and we are on pace to doubl our export one of the commit i made when i was presid that s creat ten of thousand of job all across the countri that s whi we ve kept on push trade deal but trade deal that make sure that american worker and american busi are get a good deal
p1004
aVnow governor romney talk about china as i alreadi indic in the privat sector governor romney s compani invest in what were call pioneer of outsourc that s not my phrase that s what report call it and as far as currenc manipul the currenc has actual gone up 11 percent sinc i ve been presid becaus we have push them hard and we ve put unpreced trade pressur on china that s whi export have signific increas under my presid that s go to help to creat job here
p1005
aVthe answer is veri straightforward we can compet with anyon in the world as long as the play field is level china has been cheat over the year one by hold down the valu of their currenc number two by steal our intellectu properti our design our patent our technolog there s even an appl store in china that s a counterfeit appl store sell counterfeit good they hack into our comput we will have to have peopl play on a fair basi that s number one
p1006
aVnumber two we have to make america the most attract place for entrepreneur for peopl who want to expand a busi that s what bring job in the presid s character of my tax plan is
p1007
aVhow much time you got candi
p1008
aVis complet fals let me tell you
p1009
aVthe most import thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energi so here s what i ve done sinc i ve been presid we have increas oil product to the highest level in 16 year natur gas product is the highest it s been in decad we have seen increas in coal product and coal employ
p1010
aVall right i m
p1011
aVcandi there are some job that are not go to come back becaus they re low wage low skill job i want high wage high skill job that s whi we have to emphas manufactur that s whi we have to invest in advanc manufactur that s whi we ve got to make sure that we ve got the best scienc and research in the world
p1012
aVand when we talk about deficit if we re ad to our deficit for tax cut for folk who don t need them and we re cut invest in research and scienc that will creat the next appl creat the next new innov that will sell product around the world we will lose that race if we re not train engin to make sure that they are equip here in this countri then compani won t come here those invest are what s go to help to make sure that we continu to lead this world economi not just next year but 10 year from now 50 year from now 100 year from now

aVbut what i ve also said is we can t just produc tradit sourc of energi we ve also got to look to the futur that s whi we doubl fuel effici standard on car that mean that in the middl of the next decad ani car you buy you re go to end up go twice as far on a gallon of gas that s whi we ve doubl clean energi product like wind and solar and biofuel
p1016
aVbarri oh there s barri hi barri
p1017
aVthank you and that s an opportun for me and i appreci it in the natur of a campaign it seem that some campaign are focus on attack a person rather than prescrib their own futur and the thing they d like to do in the cours of that i think the presid s campaign has tri to character me as someon who s veri differ than who i am
p1018
aVi care about 100 percent of the american peopl i want 100 percent of the american peopl to have a bright and prosper futur i care about our kid i understand what it take to make a bright and prosper futur for america again i spent my life in the privat sector not in govern i m a guy who want to help with the experi i have the american peopl
p1019
aVmy passion probabl flow from the fact that i believ in god and i believ we re all children of the same god i believ we have a respons to care for one anoth i serv as a missionari for my church i serv as a pastor in my congreg for about 10 year i ve sat across the tabl from peopl who were out of work and work with them to tri and find new work or to help them through tough time
p1020
aVi went to the olymp when they were in troubl to tri and get them on track and as governor of my state i was abl to get 100 percent of my peopl insur all my kid about 98 percent of the adult was abl also to get our school rank number one in the nation so 100 percent of our kid would have a bright opportun for a futur
p1021
aVi understand that i can get this countri on track again we don t have to settl for what we re go through we don t have to settl for gasolin at 4 we don t have to settl for unemploy at a chronic high level we don t have to settl for 47 million peopl on food stamp we don t have to settl for 50 percent of kid come out of colleg not abl to get work we don t have to settl for 23 million peopl struggl to find a good job
p1022
aVif i becom presid i ll get america work again i will get us on track to a balanc budget the presid hasn t i will i ll make sure we can reform medicar and social secur to preserv them for come generat the presid said he would he didn t
p1023
aVand all these thing have contribut to us lower our oil import to the lowest level in 16 year now i want to build on that and that mean yes we still continu to open up new area for drill we continu to make it a prioriti for us to go after natur gas we ve got potenti 600 000 job and a hundr year worth of energi right beneath our feet with natur gas and we can do it in an environment sound way
p1024
aVi ll get our incom up and by the way i ve done these thing i serv as governor and show i could get them done
p1025
aVbarri i think a lot of this campaign mayb over the last 4 year has been devot to this notion that i think govern creat job that that somehow is the answer that s not what i believ
p1026
aVi believ that the free enterpris system is the greatest engin of prosper the world has ever known i believ in self relianc and individu initi and risk taker be reward but i also believ that everybodi should have a fair shot and everybodi should do their fair share and everybodi should play by the same rule becaus that s how our economi is grown that s how we built the world s greatest middl class and that is part of what s at stake in this elect there s a fundament differ vision about how we move our countri forward
p1027
aVi believ governor romney is a good man love his famili care about his faith but i also believ that when he said behind close door that 47 percent of the countri consid themselv victim who refus person respons think about who he was talk about folk on social secur who have work all their live veteran who have sacrif for this countri student who are out there tri to hope advanc their own dream but also this countri s dream soldier who are oversea fight for us right now peopl who are work hard everi day pay payrol tax gas tax but don t make enough incom
p1028
aVand i want to fight for them that s what i ve been do for the last 4 year becaus if they succeed i believ the countri succeed
p1029
aVand when my grandfath fought in world war ii and he came back and he got a gi bill and that allow him to go to colleg that wasn t a handout that was someth that advanc the entir countri and i want to make sure that the next generat has those same opportun that s whi i m ask for your vote and that s whi i m ask for anoth 4 year
p1030
aVbut we ve also got to continu to figur out how we have effici energi becaus ultim that s how we re go to reduc demand and that s what s go to keep gas price lower
p1031
aVnow governor romney will say he s got an all of the abov plan but basic his plan is to let the oil compani write the energi polici so he s got the oil and gas part but he doesn t have the clean energi part
p1032
aVand if we re onli think about tomorrow or the next day and not think about 10 year from now we re not go to control our own econom futur becaus china germani they re make these invest and i m not go to cede those job of the futur to those countri i expect those new energi sourc to be built right here in the unit state that s go to help jeremi get a job it s also go to make sure that you re not pay as much for gas
p1033
aVwell let s look at the presid s polici all right as oppos to the rhetor becaus we ve had 4 year of polici be play out and the presid s right in term of the addit oil product but none of it came on feder land
p1034
aVas a matter of fact oil product is down 14 percent this year on feder land and gas product is down 9 percent whi becaus the presid cut in half the number of licens and permit for drill on feder land and in feder water so where did the increas come from well a lot of it came from the bakken rang in north dakota what was his particip there the administr brought a crimin action against the peopl drill up there for oil this massiv new resourc we have and what was the caus twenti or 25 bird were kill and they brought out a migratori bird act to go after them on a crimin basi
p1035
aVlook i want to make sure we use our oil our coal our gas our nuclear our renew i believ veri much in our renew capabl ethanol wind solar will be an import part of our energi mix but what we don t need is to have the presid keep us from take advantag of oil coal and gas this has not been mr oil or mr gas or mr coal talk to the peopl that are work in those industri
p1036
aVi was in coal countri peopl grab my arm and say pleas save my job the head of the epa said you can t build a coal plant he ll virtual it s virtual imposs given our regul when the presid ran for offic he said if you build a coal plant you can go ahead but you ll go bankrupt that s not the right cours for america let s take advantag of the energi resourc we have as well as the energi sourc for the futur and if we do that if we do what i m plan on do which is get us energi independ north america energi independ within 8 year you re go to see manufactur job come back becaus our energi is low cost they re alreadi begin to come back becaus of our abund energi
p1037
aVi ll get america and north america energi independ i ll do it by more drill more permit and licens we re go to bring that pipelin in from canada how in the world the presid said no to that pipelin i will never know this is about bring good job back for the middl class of america and that s what i m go to do
p1038
aVcandi there s no doubt that world demand has gone up but our product is go up and we re use oil more effici and veri littl of what governor romney just said is true
p1039
aVwe ve open up public land we re actual drill more on public land than in the previous administr and my the previous presid was an oil man and natur gas isn t just appear magic we re encourag it and work with the industri
p1040
aVand when i hear governor romney say he s a big coal guy i mean keep in mind when governor when you were governor of massachusett you stood in front of a coal plant and point at it and said this plant kill and took great pride in shut it down and now sudden you re a big champion of coal
p1041
aVso what i ve tri to do is be consist with respect to someth like coal we made the largest invest in clean coal technolog to make sure that even as we re produc more coal we re produc it cleaner and smarter same thing with oil same thing with natur gas
p1042
aVand the proof is our oil import are down to the lowest level in 20 year oil product is up natur gas product is up and most import we re also start to build car that are more effici and that s creat job that mean those car can be export becaus that s the demand around the world and it also mean that it will save money in your pocketbook that s the strategi you need an all of the abov strategi and that s what we re go to do in the next 4 year
p1043
aVbut that s not what you ve done in the last 4 year that s the problem
p1044
aVsure it is
p1045
aVnot true governor romney
p1046
aVso how much did you cut it by
p1047
aVit s not true
p1048
aVby how much did you cut them by then
p1049
aVgovernor we have actual produc more oil on
p1050
aVno no how much did you cut licens and permit
p1051
aVgovernor
p1052
aVon feder land and feder water
p1053
aVgovernor romney here s what we did there were a whole bunch of oil compani
p1054
aVno i had a question
p1055
aVno you
p1056
aVthank you jeremi i appreci your question and thank you for be here this even and to all of those from nassau counti here that have come thank you for your time thank you to hofstra univers and to candi crowley for organ and lead this event
p1057
aVand the question was how much did you cut them by how much did you cut them by
p1058
aVyou want me to answer a question i m happi to answer the question
p1059
aVall right and it is
p1060
aVhere s what happen you had a whole bunch of oil compani who had leas on public land that they weren t use so what we said was you can t just sit on this for 10 20 30 year decid when you want to drill when you want to produc when it s most profit for you these are public land so if you want to drill on public land you use it or you lose it
p1061
aVokay now that s
p1062
aVand so what we did was take away those leas and we are now relet them so that we can actual make a profit
p1063
aVand product on privat on govern land
p1064
aVand product is up
p1065
aVis down
p1066
aVno it isn t
p1067
aVthank you mr presid also for be part of this debat
p1068
aVproduct on govern land of oil is down 14 percent
p1069
aVgovernor
p1070
aVand product of gas is down 9 percent
p1071
aVwhat you re say is just not true it s just not true
p1072
aVit s absolut true look there s no question but that the peopl recogn that we have not produc more oil and gas
p1073
aVi ll give you your time go ahead
p1074
aVon feder land and in feder water and coal coal product is not up coal job are not up i was just at a coal facil where some 1 200 peopl lost their job
p1075
aVthe right cours for america is to have a true all of the abov polici i don t think anyon realli believ that you re a person who s go to be push for oil and gas and coal you ll get your chanc in a moment i m still speak
p1076
aVwell governor if you re
p1077
aVand the answer is i don t believ peopl think that s the case becaus i
p1078
aVof cours we see in syria 30 000 civilian have been kill by the militari there we see in libya an attack appar by i think we know now by terrorist of some kind against our peopl there four peopl dead our heart and mind go to them
p1079
aVright
p1080
aVno i don t becaus i think that america has to stand with democraci the notion that we would have tank run over those young peopl who were in tahrir squar that is not the kind of american leadership that john f kennedi talk about 50 year ago
p1081
aVbut what i ve also said is that now that you have a democrat elect govern in egypt that they have to make sure that they take respons for protect religi minor and we have put signific pressur on them to make sure they re do that to recogn the right of women which is critic throughout the region these countri can t develop if young women are not given the kind of educ that they need they have to abid by their treati with israel that is a red line for us becaus not onli is israel s secur at stake but our secur is at stake if that unravel
p1082
aVthey have to make sure that they re cooper with us when it come to counterterror and we will help them with respect to develop their own economi becaus ultim what s go to make the egyptian revolut success for the peopl of egypt but also for the world is if those young peopl who gather there are see opportun their aspir are similar to young peopl s here they want job they want to be abl to make sure their kid are go to a good school they want to make sure that they have a roof over their head and that they have the prospect of a better life in the futur
p1083
aVand so one of the thing that we ve been do is for exampl organ entrepreneurship confer with these egyptian to give them a sens of how they can start rebuild their economi in a way that s noncorrupt that s transpar
p1084
aVbut what is also import for us to understand is is that for america to be success in this region there are some thing that we re go to have to do here at home as well one of the challeng over the last decad is we ve done experi in nation build in place like iraq and afghanistan and we ve neglect for exampl develop our own economi our own energi sector our own educ system and it s veri hard for us to project leadership around the world when we re not do what we need to do here
p1085
aVno i believ as the presid indic and said at the time that i support his action there i felt that i wish we d have had a better vision of the futur i wish that look back at the begin of the presid s term and even further back than that that we d have recogn that there was a grow energi and passion for freedom in that part of the world and that we would have work more aggress with our friend and with other friend in the region to have them make the transit toward a more repres form of govern such that it didn t explod in the way it did
p1086
aVmali has been taken over the northern part of mali by al qaida type individu we have in egypt a muslim brotherhood presid and so what we re see is a pretti dramat revers in the kind of hope we had for that region of cours the greatest threat of all is iran 4 year closer to a nuclear weapon
p1087
aVbut onc it explod i felt the same as the presid did which is these freedom voic in the street of egypt were the peopl who were speak of our principl and presid mubarak had done thing which were unimagin and the idea of him crush his peopl was not someth that we could possibl support
p1088
aVlet me step back and talk about what i think our mission has to be in the middl east and even more broad becaus our purpos is to make sure the world is more is peac we want a peac planet we want peopl to be abl to enjoy their live and know they re go to have a bright and prosper futur and not be at war that s our purpos and the mantl of leadership for the promot the principl of peac has fallen to america we didn t ask for it but it s an honor that we have it but for us to be abl to promot those principl of peac requir us to be strong and that begin with a strong economi here at home and unfortun the economi is not stronger
p1089
aVwhen the presid of iraq excus me of iran ahmadi nejad say that our debt make us not a great countri that s a frighten thing the former chief of staff chief of the joint chief of staff said that admir mullen said that our debt is the biggest nation secur threat we face
p1090
aVthis we have weaken our economi we need a strong economi we need to have as well a strong militari our militari is second to none in the world we re bless with terrif soldier and extraordinari technolog and intellig but the idea of a trillion dollar in cut through sequestr and budget cut to the militari would chang that
p1091
aVwe need to have strong alli our associ and connect with our alli is essenti to america s strength we re the great nation that has alli 42 alli and friend around the world and final we have to stand by our principl
p1092
aVand if we re strong in each of those thing american influenc will grow but unfortun in nowher in the world is america s influenc greater today than it was 4 year ago
p1093
aVand that s becaus we ve becom weaker
p1094
aVbob i think
p1095
aVand we re go to have to recogn that we have to do as the presid has done i congratul him on take out usama bin laden and go after the leadership in al qaida but we can t kill our way out of this mess we re go to have to put in place a veri comprehens and robust strategi to help the world of islam and other part of the world reject this radic violent extrem which is it s certain not on the run it s certain not hide this is a group that is now involv in 10 or 12 countri and it present an enorm threat to our friend to the world to america long term and we must have a comprehens strategi to help reject this kind of extrem
p1096
aVwell i absolut believ that america has a respons and the privileg of help defend freedom and promot the principl that make the world more peac and those principl includ human right human digniti free enterpris freedom of express elect becaus when there are elect peopl tend to vote for peac they don t vote for war so we want to promot those principl around the world
p1097
aVwe recogn that there are place of conflict in the world we want to end those conflict to the extent human possibl but in order to be abl to fulfil our role in the world america must be strong america must lead and for that to happen we have to strengthen our economi here at home you can t have 23 million peopl struggl to get a job you can t have an economi that over the last 3 year keep slow down in it growth rate you can t have kid come out of colleg half of whom can t find a job today or a job that s commensur with their colleg degre we have to get our economi go
p1098
aVand our militari we ve got to strengthen our militari long term we don t know what the world is go to throw at us down the road we make decis today in a militari that will confront challeng we can t imagin in the 2000 debat there was no mention of terror for instanc and a year later 9 11 happen so we have to make decis base upon uncertainti and that mean a strong militari i will not cut our militari budget
p1099
aVwe have to also stand by our alli i think the tension that exist between israel and the unit state was veri unfortun i think also that pull our missil defens program out of poland in the way we did was also unfortun in term of if you will disrupt the relationship in some way that exist between us
p1100
aVand then of cours with regard to stand for our principl when the student took the street in tehran and the peopl there protest the green revolut occur for the presid to be silent i thought was an enorm mistak we have to stand for our principl stand for our alli stand for a strong militari and stand for a stronger economi
p1101
aVamerica remain the one indispens nation and the world need a strong america and it is stronger now than when i came into offic becaus we end the war in iraq we were abl to refocus our attent on not onli the terrorist threat but also begin a transit process in afghanistan
p1102
aVit also allow us to refocus on allianc and relationship that had been neglect for a decad and governor romney our allianc have never been stronger in asia in europ in africa with israel where we have unpreced militari and intellig cooper includ deal with the iranian threat
p1103
aVbut what we also have been abl to do is posit ourselv so we can start rebuild america and that s what my plan doe make sure that we re bring manufactur back to our shore so that we re creat job here as we ve done with the auto industri not reward compani that are ship job oversea make sure that we ve got the best educ system in the world includ retrain our worker for the job of tomorrow
p1104
aVdo everyth we can to control our own energi we ve cut our oil import to the lowest level in two decad becaus we ve develop oil and natur gas but we also have to develop clean energi technolog that will allow us to cut our export in half by 2020 that s the kind of leadership that we need to show
p1105
aVand we ve got to make sure that we reduc our deficit unfortun governor romney s plan doesn t do it we ve got to do it in a respons way by cut out spend we don t need but also by ask the wealthiest to pay a littl bit more that way we can invest in the research and technolog that s alway kept us at the cut edg
p1106
aVnow governor romney has taken a differ approach throughout this campaign both at home and abroad he has propos wrong and reckless polici he s prais georg bush as a good econom steward and dick cheney as somebodi who has show great wisdom and judgment and take us back to those kind of strategi that got us into this mess are not the way that we are go to maintain leadership in the 21st centuri
p1107
aVi ve got a polici for the futur and an agenda for the futur and when it come to our economi here at home i know what it take to creat 12 million new job and rise take home pay and what we ve seen over the last 4 year is someth i don t want to see over the next 4 year
p1108
aVthe presid said by now we d be at 5 4 percent unemploy we re 9 million job short of that i will get america work again and see rise take home pay again and i ll do it with five simpl step
p1109
aVnumber one we are go to have north american energi independ we re go to do it by take full advantag of oil coal gas nuclear and our renew number two we re go to increas our trade trade grow about 12 percent per year it doubl about everi 5 or so year we can do better than that particular in latin america
p1110
aVthe opportun for us in latin america we have just not taken advantag of fulli as a matter of fact latin america s economi is almost as big as the economi of china we re all focus on china latin america is a huge opportun for us time zone languag opportun
p1111
aVnumber three we re go to have to have train program that work for our worker and school that final put the parent and the teacher and the kid first and the teacher union s go to have to go behind
p1112
aVand then we re go to have to get to a balanc budget we can t expect entrepreneur and busi larg and small to take their life save or their compani s money and invest in america if they think we re head to the road to greec and that s where we re go right now unless we final get off this spend and borrow bing and i ll get us on track to a balanc budget
p1113
aVand final number five we ve got to champion small busi small busi are where job come from two third of our job come from small busi new busi format is down at the lowest level in 30 year under this administr i want to bring it back and get back good job and rise take home pay
p1114
aVwell let s talk about what we need to compet first of all governor romney talk about small busi but governor when you were in massachusett small busi develop rank about 48th i think out of 50 state in massachusett becaus the polici that you re promot actual don t help small busi and the way you defin small busi includ folk at the veri top they includ you and me that s not the kind of small busi promot we need
p1115
aVbut let s take an exampl that we know is go to make a differ in the 21st centuri and that s our educ polici we didn t have a lot of chanc to talk about this in the last debat under my leadership what we ve done is reform educ work with governor 46 state we ve seen progress and gain in school that were have a terribl time and they re start to final make progress and what i now want to do is to hire more teacher especi in math and scienc becaus we know that we ve fallen behind when it come to math and scienc and those teacher can make a differ
p1116
aVnow governor romney when you were ask by teacher whether or not this would help the economi grow you said this isn t go to help the economi grow when you were ask about reduc class size you said class size don t make a differ but i tell you if you talk to teacher they will tell you it doe make a differ and if we ve got math teacher who are abl to provid the kind of support that they need for our kid that s what s go to determin whether or not the new busi are creat here compani are go to locat here depend on whether we ve got the most high skill workforc
p1117
aVand the kind of budget propos that you ve put forward when we don t ask either you or me to pay a dime more in term of reduc the deficit but instead we slash support for educ that s undermin our long term competit that is not good for america s posit in the world and the world notic
p1118
aVwell my first job as command in chief bob is to keep the american peopl safe and that s what we ve done over the last 4 year we end the war in iraq refocus our attent on those who actual kill us on 9 11 and as a consequ al qaida s core leadership has been decim
p1119
aVwell look
p1120
aVwell i need to speak a moment if you ll let me bob
p1121
aVten year earlier governor
p1122
aVbut that was 10 year befor you took offic
p1123
aVin addit we re now abl to transit out of afghanistan in a respons way make sure that afghan take respons for their own secur and that allow us also to rebuild allianc and make friend around the world to combat futur threat now with respect to libya as i indic in the last debat when we receiv that phone call i immedi made sure that number one we did everyth we could to secur those american who were still in harm s way number two that we would investig exact what happen and number three most import that we would go after those who kill american and we would bring them to justic and that s exact what we re go to do
p1124
aVand this is and we were
p1125
aVabsolut
p1126
aVand then you cut educ spend when you came into offic
p1127
aVthe first and we kept our school number one in the nation they re still number one today
p1128
aVand the principl that we put in place we also gave kid not just a graduat exam that determin whether they were up to the skill need to be abl to compet but also if they graduat in the top quarter of their class they got a 4 year tuition free ride at ani massachusett public institut of higher learn
p1129
aVthat happen befor you came into offic though
p1130
aVthat was actual mine actual mr presid you ve got that fact wrong
p1131
aVbut i think it s import to step back and think about what happen in libya now keep in mind that i and american took leadership in organ an intern coalit that made sure that we were abl to without put troop on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in 2 week in iraq liber a countri that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 year got rid of a despot who had kill american and as a consequ despit this tragedi you had ten of thousand of libyan after the event in benghazi march and say america is our friend we stand with them now that repres the opportun we have to take advantag of
p1132
aVwell let s come back and talk about the militari but all the way through first of all i m go through from the veri begin we re go to cut about 5 percent of the discretionari budget exclud militari that s number one all right and that s
p1133
aVthe good news is i ll be happi to have you take a look come on our web site you ll look at how we get to a balanc budget within 8 to 10 year we do it by get by reduc spend in a whole seri of program by the way number one i get rid of is obamacar there are a number of thing that sound good but frank we just can t afford them and that one doesn t sound good and it s not afford so i get rid of that one from day one to the extent human possibl we get that out we take program after program that we don t absolut have to have and we get rid of them
p1134
aVnumber two we take some program that we are go to keep like medicaid which is a program for the poor we take that health care program for the poor and we give it to the state to run becaus state run these program more effici as a governor i thought pleas give me this program i can run this more effici than the feder govern
p1135
aVand state by the way are prove it state like arizona rhode island have taken these medicaid dollar have shown they can run these program more cost effect
p1136
aVbob
p1137
aVand so i want to do those two thing it get us to a balanc budget within 8 to 10 year
p1138
aVand governor romney i m glad that you agre that we have been success in go after al qaida but i have to tell you that your strategi previous has been one that has been all over the map and is not design to keep american safe or to build on the opportun that exist in the middl east
p1139
aVbob
p1140
aVlet s get back to the militari though
p1141
aVbut he should have answer the first question
p1142
aVlook governor romney has call for 5 trillion of tax cut that he say he s go to pay for by close deduct now the math doesn t work but he continu to claim that he s go to do it he then want to spend anoth 2 trillion on militari spend that our militari is not ask for
p1143
aVnow keep in mind that our militari spend has gone up everi singl year that i ve been in offic we spend more on our militari than the next 10 countri combin china russia franc the unit kingdom you name it next 10 and what i did was work with our joint chief of staff to think about what are we go to need in the futur to make sure that we are safe and that s the budget that we ve put forward
p1144
aVbut what you can t do is spend 2 trillion in addit militari spend that the militari is not ask for 5 trillion on tax cut you say that you re go to pay for it by close loophol and deduct without name what those loophol and deduct are and then somehow you re also go to deal with the deficit that we ve alreadi got the math simpli doesn t work
p1145
aVbut when it come to our militari what we have to think about is not just budget we ve got think about capabl we need to be think about cybersecur we need to be think about space that s exact what our budget doe but it s driven by strategi it s not driven by polit it s not driven by member of congress and what they would like to see it s driven by what are we go to need to keep the american peopl safe that s exact what our budget doe
p1146
aVand it also then allow us to reduc our deficit which is a signific nation secur concern becaus we ve got to make sure that our economi is strong at home so that we can project militari power oversea
p1147
aVbob i m pleas that i ve balanc budget i was in the world of busi for 25 year you didn t balanc your budget you went out of busi i went to the olymp that was out of balanc and we got it on balanc and made a success there i had the chanc to be governor of a state 4 year in a row democrat and republican came togeth to balanc the budget we cut tax 19 time balanc our budget
p1148
aVthe presid hasn t balanc a budget yet i expect to have the opportun to do so myself
p1149
aVi m go to be abl to balanc the budget
p1150
aVlet s talk about militari spend and that s this our navi
p1151
aVour navi is older excus me our navi is smaller now than ani time sinc 1917 the navi said they need 313 ship to carri out their mission we re now down to 285 we re head down to the low two hundr if we go through with sequestr that s unaccept to me i want to make sure that we have the ship that are requir by our navi
p1152
aVour air forc is older and smaller than ani time sinc it was found in 1947 we ve chang for the first time sinc fdr sinc fdr we had the we ve alway had the strategi of say we could fight in two conflict at onc now we re chang to one conflict
p1153
aVwell my strategi is pretti straightforward which is to go after the bad guy to make sure we do our veri best to interrupt them to kill them to take them out of the pictur but my strategi is broader than that that s import of cours but the key that we re go to have to pursu is a pathway to get the muslim world to be abl to reject extrem on it own we don t want anoth iraq we don t want anoth afghanistan that s not the right cours for us
p1154
aVlook this in my view is the highest respons of the presid of the unit state which is to maintain the safeti of the american peopl and i will not cut our militari budget by a trillion dollar which is the combin of the budget cut that the presid has as well as the sequestr cut that in my view is make our futur less certain and less secur
p1155
aVbob i just need to comment on this first of all the sequest is not someth that i propos it s someth that congress has propos it will not happen the budget that we re talk about is not reduc our militari spend it s maintain it
p1156
aVand we visit the web site quit a bit and it still doesn t work
p1157
aVfirst of all israel is a true friend it is our greatest alli in the region and if israel is attack america will stand with israel i ve made that clear throughout my presid
p1158
aVthe right cours for us is to make sure that we go after the peopl who are leader of these various anti american group and these jihadist but also help the muslim world and how do we do that the group of arab scholar came togeth organ by the u n to look at how we can help the world reject these terrorist and the answer they came up with was this one more econom develop we should key our foreign aid our direct foreign invest and that of our friend we should coordin it to make sure that we push back and give them more econom develop number two better educ number three gender equal number four the rule of law we have to help these nation creat civil societi
p1159
aVi will stand with israel if they are attack and this is the reason whi work with israel we have creat the strongest militari and intellig cooper between our two countri in histori in fact this week we ll be carri out the largest militari exercis with israel in histori this veri week
p1160
aVbut to the issu of iran as long as i m presid of the unit state iran will not get a nuclear weapon i made that clear when i came into offic we then organ the strongest coalit and the strongest sanction against iran in histori and it is crippl their economi their currenc has drop 80 percent their oil product has plung to the lowest level sinc they were fight a war with iraq 20 year ago so their economi is in a shambl
p1161
aVand the reason we did this is becaus a nuclear iran is a threat to our nation secur and it s a threat to israel s nation secur we cannot afford to have a nuclear arm race in the most volatil region in the world iran is a state sponsor of terror and for them to be abl to provid nuclear technolog to nonstat actor that s unaccept and they have said that they want to see israel wipe off the map
p1162
aVso the work that we ve done with respect to sanction now offer iran a choic they can take the diplomat rout and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a unit world and a unit state presid me who said we re not go to take ani option off the tabl
p1163
aVthe disagr i have with governor romney is that dure the cours of this campaign he s often talk as if we should take prematur militari action i think that would be a mistak becaus when i ve sent young men and women into harm s way i alway understand that that is the last resort not the first resort
p1164
aVwell first of all i want to underscor the same point the presid made which is that if i m presid of the unit state when i m presid of the unit state we will stand with israel and if israel is attack we have their back not just diplomat not just cultur but militarili that s number one
p1165
aVnumber two with regard to iran and the threat of iran there s no question but that a nuclear iran a nuclear capabl iran is unaccept to america it present a threat not onli to our friend but ultim a threat to us to have iran have nuclear materi nuclear weapon that could be use against us or use to be threaten to us
p1166
aVit s also essenti for us to understand what our mission is in iran and that is to dissuad iran from have a nuclear weapon through peac and diplomat mean and crippl sanction are someth i call for 5 year ago when i was in israel speak at the herzliya confer i laid out seven step crippl sanction were number one and they do work you re see it right now in the economi it s absolut the right thing to do to have crippl sanction i d have put them in place earlier but it s good that we have them
p1167
aVbut what s been happen over the last coupl of year is as we ve watch this tumult in the middl east this rise tide of chao occur you see al qaida rush in you see other jihadist group rush in and they re throughout mani nation in the middl east
p1168
aVnumber two someth i would add today is i would tighten those sanction i would say that ship that carri iranian oil can t come into our port i imagin the eu would agre with us as well not onli ship couldn t i d say compani that are move their oil can t peopl who are trade in their oil can t i would tighten those sanction further
p1169
aVsecond i d take on diplomat isol effort i d make sure that ahmadi nejad is indict under the genocid convent his word amount to genocid incit i would indict him for it i would also make sure that their diplomat are treat like the pariah they are around the world the same way we treat the apartheid diplomat of south africa we need to increas pressur time and time again on iran becaus anyth other than a solut to this which say which stop this nuclear folli of their is unaccept to america
p1170
aVand of cours a militari action is the last resort it is someth one would onli onli consid if all of the other avenu had been tri to their full extent
p1171
aVwell first of all those are report in the newspap they are not true but our goal is to get iran to recogn it need to give up it nuclear program and abid by the u n resolut that have been in place becaus they have the opportun to reenter the communiti of nation and we would welcom that
p1172
aVthere are peopl in iran who have the same aspir as peopl all around the world for a better life and we hope that their leadership take the right decis but the deal we ll accept is they end their nuclear program it s veri straightforward
p1173
aVand i m glad that governor romney agre with the step that we re take there have been time governor frank dure the cours of this campaign where it sound like you thought that you d do the same thing we did but you d say them louder and somehow that would make a differ and it turn out that the work involv in set up these crippl sanction is painstak it s meticul
p1174
aVwe start from the day we got into offic and the reason it was so import and this is a testament to how we ve restor american credibl and strength around the world is we had to make sure that all the countri particip even countri like russia and china becaus if it s just us that are impos sanction we ve had sanction in place for a long time it s becaus we got everybodi to agre that iran is see so much pressur and we ve got to maintain that pressur
p1175
aVit s wonder that libya seem to be make some progress despit this terribl tragedi but next door of cours we have egypt libya is 6 million popul egypt 80 million popul we want to make sure that we re see progress throughout the middl east with mali now have north mali taken over by al qaida with syria have asad continu to assassin to kill to murder his own peopl this is a region in tumult
p1176
aVthere is a deal to be had and that is that they abid by the rule that have alreadi been establish they convinc the intern communiti they are not pursu a nuclear program there are inspect that are veri intrus but over time what they can do is regain credibl
p1177
aVin the meantim though we re not go to let up the pressur until we have clear evid that that take place
p1178
aVand one last thing just to make this point the clock is tick we re not go to allow iran to perpetu engag in negoti that lead nowher and i ve been veri clear to them becaus of the intellig coordin that we do with a rang of countri includ israel we have a sens of when they would get breakout capac which mean that we would not be abl to interven in time to stop their nuclear program and that clock is tick
p1179
aVand we re go to make sure that if they do not meet the demand of the intern communiti then we are go to take all option necessari to make sure they don t have a nuclear weapon
p1180
aVi think from the veri begin one of the challeng we ve had with iran is that they have look at this administr and felt that the administr was not as strong as it need to be i think they saw weak where they had expect to find american strength
p1181
aVand i say that becaus from the veri begin the presid in his campaign some 4 year ago said he d meet with all the world s worst actor in his first year he d sit down with chavez and kim jong il with castro and with presid ahmadi nejad of iran and i think they look and thought well that s an unusu honor to receiv from the presid of the unit state
p1182
aVand then the presid began what i ve call an apolog tour of go to various nation in the middl east and critic america i think they look at that and saw weak then when there were dissid in the street of tehran a green revolut hold sign say is america with us the presid was silent i think they notic that as well and i think that when the presid said he was go to creat daylight between ourselv and israel that they notic that as well
p1183
aVall of these thing suggest i think to the iranian mullah that hey we can keep on push along here we can keep talk go on but we re just go to keep on spin centrifug now there are some 10 000 centrifug spin uranium prepar to creat a nuclear threat to the unit state and to the world that s unaccept for us
p1184
aVand it s essenti for a presid to show strength from the veri begin to make it veri clear what is accept and not accept and an iranian nuclear program is not accept to us they must not develop nuclear capabl and the way to make sure they understand that is by have from the veri begin the tightest sanction possibl they need to be tighten our diplomat isol need to be tougher we need to indict ahmadi nejad we need to put the pressur on them as hard as we possibl can becaus if we do that we won t have to take the militari action
p1185
aVbob let me just respond noth governor romney just said is true start with this notion of me apolog this has been probabl the biggest whopper that s been told dure the cours of this campaign and everi fact checker and everi report who s look at it governor has said this is not true
p1186
aVand when it come to tighten sanction look as i said befor we ve put in the toughest most crippl sanction ever and the fact is while we were coordin an intern coalit to make sure these sanction were effect you were still invest in a chines state oil compani that was do busi with the iranian oil sector so i ll let the american peopl decid judg who is go to be more effect and more credibl when it come to impos crippl sanction
p1187
aVand with respect to our attitud about the iranian revolut i was veri clear about the murder activ that had taken place and that was contrari to intern law and everyth that civil peopl stand for and so the strength that we have shown in iran is shown by the fact that we ve been abl to mobil the world
p1188
aVwhen i came into offic the world was divid iran was resurg iran is at it weakest point econom strateg militarili than sinc than in mani year and we are go to continu to keep the pressur on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon that s in america s nation interest and that will be the case so long as i m presid
p1189
aVwe re 4 year closer to a nuclear iran we re 4 year closer to a nuclear iran and we should not have wast these 4 year to the extent they ve continu to be abl to spin these centrifug and get that much closer that s number one
p1190
aVnumber two mr presid the reason i call it an apolog tour is becaus you went to the middl east and you flew to egypt and to saudi arabia and to turkey and iraq and by the way you skip israel our closest friend in the region but you went to the other nation and by the way they notic that you skip israel and then in those nation and on arab tv you said that america had been dismiss and deris you said that on occas america has dictat to other nation mr presid america has not dictat to other nation we have freed other nation from dictat
p1191
aVbob let me respond if we re go to talk about trip that we ve taken when i was a candid for offic the first trip i took was to visit our troop and when i went to israel as a candid i didn t take donor i didn t attend fundrais i went to yad vashem the holocaust museum there to remind myself the natur of evil and whi our bond with israel will be unbreak
p1192
aVand then i went down to the border town of sderot which had experienc missil rain down from hama and i saw famili there who show me where missil had come down near their children s bedroom and i was remind of what that would mean if those were my kid which is whi as presid we fund an iron dome program to stop those missil so that s how i ve use my travel when i travel to israel and when i travel to the region
p1193
aVand of cours iran on the path to a nuclear weapon we ve got real problem in the region
p1194
aVand the central question at this point is go to be who s go to be credibl to all parti involv and they can look at my track record whether it s iran s sanction whether it s deal with counterterror whether it s support democraci whether it s support women s right whether it s support religi minor and they can say that the presid of the unit state and the unit state of america has stood on the right side of histori and that kind of credibl is precis whi we ve been abl to show leadership on a wide rang of issu face the world right now
p1195
aVbob it s not let s not go into hypothet of that natur our relationship with israel my relationship with the prime minist of israel is such that we would not get a call say our bomber are on the way or their fighter are on the way this is the kind of thing that would have been discuss and thorough evalu well befor that kind of last minut
p1196
aVi m just say that s just not
p1197
aVbut let me
p1198
aVthe
p1199
aVlet s come back to what the presid was speak about which is what s happen in the world and the presid s statement that thing are go so well look i look at what s happen around the world and i see iran 4 year closer to a bomb i see the middl east with a rise tide of violenc chao tumult i see jihadist continu to spread whether they re rise or just about the same level hard to precis measur but this it s clear they re there they re veri strong i see syria with 30 000 civilian dead asad still in power i see our trade deficit with china larger than it s grow larger everi year as a matter of fact i look around the world and i don t feel that you see north korea continu to export their nuclear technolog russia has said they re not go to follow nunn lugar anymor they re back away from a nuclear prolifer treati that we had with them
p1200
aVi look around the world i don t see our influenc grow around the world i see our influenc reced in part becaus of the failur of the presid to deal with our econom challeng at home in part becaus of our withdraw from our commit to our militari in the way i think it ought to be in part becaus of the turmoil with israel i mean the presid receiv a letter from 38 democrat senat say that tension
p1201
aVbob
p1202
aVwith israel were a real problem they ask him pleas repair the tension democrat senat pleas repair the damag in his own parti
p1203
aVgovernor the problem is is that on a whole rang of issu whether it s the middl east whether it s afghanistan whether it s iraq whether it s now iran you ve been all over the map i mean i m pleas that you now are endors our polici of appli diplomat pressur and potenti have bilater discuss with the iranian to end their nuclear program
p1204
aVbut just a few year ago you said that s someth you d never do in the same way that you initi oppos a timet in afghanistan now you re for it although it depend in the same way that you say you would have end the war in iraq but recent gave a speech say that we should have 20 000 more folk in there the same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after qaddafi
p1205
aVwhen it come to go after usama bin laden you said well ani presid would make that call but when you were a candid in 2008 as i was and i said if i got bin laden in our sight i would take that shot you said we shouldn t move heaven and earth to get one man and you said we should ask pakistan for permiss and if we had ask pakistan for permiss we would not have gotten him and it was worth move heaven and earth to get him
p1206
aVafter we kill bin laden i was at ground zero for a memori and talk to a young woman who was 4 year old when 9 11 happen and the last convers she had with her father was him call from the twin tower say payton i love you and i will alway watch over you and for the next decad she was haunt by that convers and she said to me by final get bin laden that brought some closur to me and when we do thing like that when we bring those who have harm us to justic that send a messag to the world and it tell payton that we did not forget her father
p1207
aVand i make that point becaus that s the kind of clariti of leadership and those decis are not alway popular those decis general are not poll test and even some in my own parti includ my current vice presid had the same critiqu as you did but what the american peopl understand is is that i look at what we need to get done to keep the american peopl safe and to move our interest forward and i make those decis
p1208
aVbob
p1209
aVwell that s probabl true
p1210
aVwe ll agre on that
p1211
aVgovernor romney i m glad that you recogn that al qaida is a threat becaus a few month ago when you were ask what s the biggest geopolit threat face america you said russia not al qaida you said russia and the 1980s are now call to ask for their foreign polici back becaus the cold war has been over for 20 year
p1212
aVwell we re go to be finish by 2014 and when i m presid we ll make sure we bring our troop out by the end of 2014 the command and the general there are on track to do so we ve seen progress over the past sever year the surg has been success and the train program is proceed apac there are now a larg number of afghan secur forc 350 000 that are readi to step in to provid secur and we re go to be abl to make that transit by the end of 2014 so our troop will come home at that point
p1213
aVi can tell you at the same time that we will make sure that we look at what s happen in pakistan and recogn that what s happen in pakistan is go to have a major impact on the success in afghanistan and i say that becaus i know a lot of peopl just feel like we should brush our hand and walk away and i don t mean you mr presid but some peopl in our nation feel that pakistan isn t be nice to us and that we should just walk away from them
p1214
aVpakistan is import to the region to the world and to us becaus pakistan has a hundr nuclear warhead and they re rush to build a lot more they ll have more than great britain sometim in the relat near futur they also have the haqqani network and the taliban exist within their countri
p1215
aVand so a pakistan that fall apart becom a fail state would be of extraordinari danger to afghanistan and to us and so we re go to have to remain help in encourag pakistan to move toward a more stabl govern and rebuild a relationship with us and that mean that our aid that we provid to pakistan is go to have to be condit upon certain benchmark be met so for me i look at this as both a need to help move pakistan in the right direct and also to get afghanistan to be readi and they will be readi by the end of 2014
p1216
aVwhen i came into offic we were still bog down in iraq and afghanistan had been drift for a decad we end the war in iraq refocus our attent on afghanistan and we did deliv a surg of troop that was facilit in part becaus we had end the war in iraq and we are now in a posit where we have met mani of the object that got us there in the first place
p1217
aVpart of what had happen is we had forgotten whi we had gone we went becaus there were peopl who were respons for 3 000 american death and so we decim al qaida s core leadership in the border region between afghanistan and pakistan we then start to build up afghan forc and we re now in a posit where we can transit out becaus there s no reason whi american should die when afghan are perfect capabl of defend their own countri
p1218
aVnow that transit has to take place in a respons fashion we ve been there a long time and we ve got to make sure that we and our coalit partner are pull out respons and give afghan the capabl that they need
p1219
aVbut governor when it come to our foreign polici you seem to want to import the foreign polici of the 1980s just like the social polici of the 1950s and the econom polici of the 1920s
p1220
aVbut what i think the american peopl recogn is after a decad of war it s time to do some nation build here at home and what we can now do is free up some resourc to for exampl put american back to work especi our veteran rebuild our road our bridg our school make sure that our veteran are get the care that they need when it come to posttraumat stress disord and traumat brain injuri make sure that the certif that they need for good job of the futur are in place
p1221
aVi was have lunch with some a veteran in minnesota who had been a medic deal with the most extrem circumst when he came home and he want to becom a nurs he had to start from scratch and what we ve said is let s chang those certif the first ladi has done great work with an organ call join forc put our veteran back to work and as a consequ veteran unemploy is actual now lower than the general popul it was higher when i came into offic
p1222
aVso those are the kind of thing that we can now do becaus we re make that transit in afghanistan
p1223
aVno it s not time to divorc a nation on earth that has a hundr nuclear weapon and is on the way to doubl that at some point a nation that has serious threat from terrorist group within it nation as i indic befor the taliban the haqqani network it s a nation that s not like other and it doe not have a civilian leadership that is call the shot there you ve got the isi their intellig organ that s probabl the most power of three branch there then you have the militari and then you have the civilian govern
p1224
aVthis is a nation which if it fall apart if it becom a fail state there are nuclear weapon there and you ve got terrorist there who could grab their hand onto those nuclear weapon this is an import part of the world for us pakistan is technic an alli and they re not act veri much like an alli right now but we have some work to do
p1225
aVand i don t blame the administr for the fact that the relationship with pakistan is strain we had to go into pakistan we had to go in there to get usama bin laden that was the right thing to do and that upset them but there was obvious a great deal of anger even befor that but we re go to have to work with the peopl in pakistan to tri and help them move to a more respons cours than the one that they re on
p1226
aVit s import for them it s import for the nuclear weapon it s import for the success of afghanistan becaus insid pakistan you have a larg group of pashtun that are taliban they re go to come rush back in to afghanistan when we go and that s one of the reason the afghan secur forc have so much work to do to be abl to fight against that
p1227
aVbut it s import for us to recogn that we can t just walk away from pakistan but we do need to make sure that as we send support for them that this is tie to them make progress on matter that would lead them to becom a civil societi
p1228
aVyou say that you re not interest in duplic what happen in iraq but just a few week ago you said you think we should have more troop in iraq right now and the challeng we have i know you haven t been in a posit to actual execut foreign polici but everi time you ve offer an opinion you ve been wrong you said we should have gone into iraq despit the fact that there were no weapon of mass destruct you said that we should still have troop in iraq to this day
p1229
aVwell i believ that we should use ani and all mean necessari to take out peopl who pose a threat to us and our friend around the world and it s wide report that drone are be use in drone strike and i support that entir and feel the presid was right to up the usag of that technolog and believ that we should continu to use it to continu to go after the peopl who repres a threat to this nation and to our friend
p1230
aVlet me also note that as i said earlier we re go to have to do more than just go after leader and kill bad guy import as that is we re also go to have to have a far more effect and comprehens strategi to help move the world away from terror and islam extrem we haven t done that yet
p1231
aVwe talk a lot about these thing but you look at the record you look at the record of the last 4 year and say is iran closer to a bomb yes is the middl east in tumult yes is al qaeda on the run on it heel no is are israel and the palestinian closer to reach a peac agreement no they haven t had talk in 2 year we have not seen the progress we need to have and i m convinc that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategi base upon help these nation reject extrem we can see the kind of peac and prosper the world demand
p1232
aVwell keep in mind our strategi wasn t just go after bin laden we ve creat partnership throughout the region to deal with extrem in somalia in yemen in pakistan and what we ve also done is engag these govern in the kind of reform that are actual go to make a differ in peopl s live day to day to make sure that their govern aren t corrupt to make sure that they are treat women with the kind of respect and digniti that everi nation that succeed has shown and to make sure that they ve got a free market system that work so across the board we are engag them in build capac in these countri and we have stood on the side of democraci
p1233
aVone thing i think american should be proud of when tunisian began to protest this nation me my administr stood with them earlier than just about ani other countri in egypt we stood on the side of democraci in libya we stood on the side of the peopl and as a consequ there s no doubt that attitud about american have chang
p1234
aVbut there are alway go to be element in these countri that potenti threaten the unit state and we want to shrink those group and those network and we can do that but we re alway also go to have to maintain vigil when it come to terrorist activ the truth though is that al qaida is much weaker than it was when i came into offic and they don t have the same capac to attack the u s homeland and our alli as they did 4 year ago
p1235
aVyou indic that we shouldn t be pass nuclear treati with russia despit the fact that 71 senat democrat and republican vote for it you ve said that first we should not have a timelin in afghanistan then you said we should now you say mayb or it depend which mean not onli were you wrong but you were also confus and send mix messag both to our troop and our alli
p1236
aVwell i think it will continu to be terrorist network we have to remain vigil as i just said but with respect to china china is both an adversari but also a potenti partner in the intern communiti if it s follow the rule so my attitud come into offic was that we are go to insist that china play by the same rule as everybodi els
p1237
aVnow i know american had seen job be ship oversea busi and worker not get a level play field when it came to trade and that s the reason whi i set up a trade task forc to go after cheater when it came to intern trade that s the reason whi we have brought more case against china for violat trade rule than the other the previous administr had done in two term and we ve won just about everi case that we file that has been decid
p1238
aVin fact just recent steelwork in ohio and throughout the midwest pennsylvania are in a posit now to sell steel to china becaus we won that case we had a tire case in which they were flood us with cheap domest tire or cheap chines tire and we put a stop to it and as a consequ save job throughout america
p1239
aVi have to say that governor romney critic me for be too tough in that tire case said this wouldn t be good for american worker and that it would be protectionist but i tell you those worker don t feel that way they feel as if they had final an administr who was go to take this issu serious
p1240
aVover the long term in order for us to compet with china we ve also got to make sure though that we re take care of busi here at home if we don t have the best educ system in the world if we don t continu to put money into research and technolog that will allow us to creat great busi here in the unit state that s how we lose the competit and unfortun governor romney s budget and his propos would not allow us to make those invest
p1241
aVwell first of all it s not govern that make busi success it s not govern invest that make busi grow and hire peopl let me also note that the greatest threat that the world face the greatest nation secur threat is a nuclear iran
p1242
aVlet s talk about china china has an interest that s veri much like our in one respect and that is they want a stabl world they don t want war they don t want to see protection they don t want to see the world break out into various form of chao becaus they have to manufactur good and put peopl to work they have about 20 000 20 million rather peopl come out of the farm everi year come into the citi need job so they want the economi to work and the world to be free and open and so we can be a partner with china we don t have to be an adversari in ani way shape or form we can work with them we can collabor with them if they re will to be respons
p1243
aVnow they look at us and say is it a good idea to be with america how strong are we go to be how strong is our economi they look at the fact that we owe them a trillion dollar and owe other peopl 16 trillion in total includ them they look at our decis to cut back on our militari capabl a trillion dollar the secretari of defens call these trillion dollar of cut to our militari devast it s not my term it s the presid s own secretari of defens call them devast they look at america s commit around the world and they see what s happen and they say well okay is america go to be strong and the answer is yes if i m presid america will be veri strong
p1244
aVso what we need to do with respect to the middl east is strong steadi leadership not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map and unfortun that s the kind of opinion that you ve offer throughout this campaign and it is not a recip for american strength or keep america safe over the long term
p1245
aVwe ll also make sure that we have trade relat with china that work for us i ve watch year in and year out as compani have shut down and peopl have lost their job becaus china has not play by the same rule in part by hold down artifici the valu of their currenc it hold down the price of their good it mean our good aren t as competit and we lose job that s got to end they re make some progress they need to make more that s whi on day one i will label them a currenc manipul which allow us to appli tariff where they re take job
p1246
aVthey re steal our intellectu properti our patent our design our technolog hack into our comput counterfeit our good they have to understand we want to trade with them we want a world that s stabl we like free enterpris but you ve got to play by the rule
p1247
aVwell they sell us about this much stuff everi year and we sell them about this much stuff everi year so it s pretti clear who doesn t want a trade war and there s one go on right now which we don t know about it s a silent one and they re win we have enorm trade imbal with china and it s wors this year than last year and it s worst last year than the year befor
p1248
aVand so we have to understand that we can t just surrend and lose job year in and year out we have to say to our friend in china look you guy are play aggress we understand it but this can t keep on go you can t keep on hold down the valu of your currenc steal our intellectu properti counterfeit our product sell them around the world even into the unit state
p1249
aVi was with one compani that make valv in process industri and they said look we were have some valv come in that were broken and we had to repair them under warranti and we look them up and they had our serial number on them and then we notic that there was more than one with that same serial number there were counterfeit product be made oversea with the same serial number as a u s compani the same packag these were be sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the u s competitor this can t go on i want a great relationship with china china can be our partner but that doesn t mean they can just roll all over us and steal our job on an unfair basi
p1250
aVwell governor romney is right you are familiar with job be ship oversea becaus you invest in compani that were ship job oversea and that s your right i mean that s how our free market work but i ve made a differ bet on american worker
p1251
aVif we had taken your advic governor romney about our auto industri we d be buy car from china instead of sell car to china if we take your advic with respect to how we chang our tax code so that compani that are in profit oversea don t pay u s tax compar to compani here that are pay tax that s estim to creat 800 000 job the problem is they won t be here they ll be in place like china
p1252
aVand if we re not make invest in educ and basic research which is not someth that the privat sector is do at a suffici pace right now and has never done then we will lose the lead in thing like clean energi technolog
p1253
aVnow with respect to what we ve done with china alreadi u s export have doubl sinc i came into offic to china and actual currenc are at their most advantag point for u s export sinc 1993 we absolut have to make more progress and that s whi we re go to keep on press
p1254
aVand when it come to our militari and chines secur part of the reason that we were abl to pivot to the asia pacif region after have end the war in iraq and transit out of afghanistan is precis becaus this is go to be a massiv growth area in the futur
p1255
aVand we believ china can be a partner but we re also send a veri clear signal that america is a pacif power that we are go to have a presenc there we are work with countri in the region to make sure for exampl that ship can pass through that commerc continu and we re organ trade relat with countri other than china so that china start feel more pressur about meet basic intern standard that s the kind of leadership we ve shown in the region that s the kind of leadership that we ll continu to show
p1256
aVi just want to take one of those point again attack me is not talk about an agenda for get more trade and open up more job in this countri but the presid mention the auto industri and that somehow i would be in favor of job be elsewher noth could be further from the truth i m a son of detroit i was born in detroit my dad was head of a car compani i like american car and i would do noth to hurt the u s auto industri
p1257
aVmy plan to get the industri on it feet when it was in real troubl was not to start write check it was presid bush that wrote the first check i disagre with that i said they need these compani need to go through a manag bankruptci and in that process they can get govern help and govern guarante but they need to go through bankruptci to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they d built up and fortun the presid took
p1258
aVgovernor romney that s not what you said
p1259
aVfortun the presid you can take a look at the op ed you can take a look at the op ed
p1260
aVgovernor romney you did not say that you would provid governor help
p1261
aVyou know i m still speak i said that we would provid guarante and that was what was abl to allow these compani to go through bankruptci to come out of bankruptci under no circumst would i do anyth other than to help this industri get on it feet and the idea that has been suggest that i would liquid the industri of cours not of cours not
p1262
aVlet s check the record
p1263
aVthat s the height of silli i have never said i would
p1264
aVlet s check the record
p1265
aVgovernor the peopl of detroit don t forget
p1266
aVand that s whi i have the kind of commit to make sure that our industri in this countri can compet and be success we in this countri can compet success with anyon in the world and we re go to we re go to have to have a presid howev that doesn t think that somehow the govern invest in car compani like tesla and fisker make electr batteri car this is not research mr presid these are the govern invest in compani invest in solyndra this is a compani this isn t basic research i want to invest in research research is great provid fund to univers and think tank great but invest in compani absolut not that s the wrong way to go
p1267
aVgovernor the fact of the matter is
p1268
aVi m still speak so i want to make sure that we make america more competit and that we do those thing that make america the most attract place in the world for entrepreneur innov busi to grow but your invest in compani doesn t do that in fact it make it less like for them to come here becaus the privat sector is not go to invest in a solar compani
p1269
aVwell of cours i don t concur with what the presid said about my own record and the thing that i ve said they don t happen to be accur
p1270
ag657
aVlook i think anybodi out there can check the record governor romney you keep on tri to airbrush histori here you were veri clear that you would not provid govern assist to the u s auto compani even if they went through bankruptci you said that they could get it in the privat marketplac that wasn t true they would have gone through
p1271
aVyou re wrong you re wrong mr presid
p1272
aVno i am not wrong
p1273
aVyou re wrong
p1274
aVi am not wrong
p1275
aVpeopl can look it up you re right
p1276
aVpeopl will look it up
p1277
aVgood
p1278
aVbut i can say this that we re talk about the middl east and how to help the middl east reject the kind of terror we re see and the rise tide of tumult and confus and attack me is not an agenda attack me is not talk about how we re go to deal with the challeng that exist in the middl east and take advantag of the opportun there and stem the tide of this violenc
p1279
aVbut more import it is true that in order for us to be competit we re go to have to make some smart choic right now cut our educ budget that s not a smart choic that will not help us compet with china cut our invest in research and technolog that s not a smart choic that will not help us compet with china bring down our deficit by ad 7 trillion of tax cut and militari spend that our militari is not ask for befor we even get to the debt that we current have that is not go to make us more competit
p1280
aVthose are the kind of choic that the american peopl face right now have a tax code that reward compani that are ship job oversea instead of compani that are invest here in the unit state that will not make us more competit and the one thing that i m absolut clear about is that after a decad in which we saw a drift job be ship oversea nobodi champion american worker and american busi we ve now begun to make some real progress what we can t do is go back to the same polici that got us into such difficulti in the first place and that s whi we have to move forward and not go back
p1281
aVi couldn t agre more about go forward but i certain don t want to go back to the polici of the last 4 year the polici of the last 4 year has seen incom in america declin everi year for middl incom famili now down 4 300 dure your term twenti three million american still struggl to find a good job
p1282
aVwhen you came to offic 32 million peopl on food stamp today 47 million peopl on food stamp when you came to offic just over 10 trillion in debt now 16 trillion in debt it hasn t work you said by now we d be at 5 4 percent unemploy we re 9 million job short of that i ve met some of those peopl i met them in appleton wisconsin i met a young woman in philadelphia who s come out of colleg can t find work ann was with someon just the other day that was just weep about not be abl to get work it s just a tragedi in a nation so prosper as our that these last 4 year have been so hard
p1283
aVand that s whi it s so critic that we make america onc again the most attract place in the world to start busi to build job to grow the economi and that s not go to happen by just hire teacher
p1284
aVlook i d love to i love teacher and i m happi to have state and communiti that want to hire teacher do that by the way i don t like to have the feder govern start push it way deeper and deeper into our school let the state and local do that i was a governor the feder govern didn t hire our teacher
p1285
aVbut i love teacher but i want to get our privat sector grow and i know how to do it
p1286
aVbut i ll respond to a coupl of the thing you mention first of all russia i indic is a geopolit foe not a
p1287
aVwell thank you veri much bob governor romney and to lynn univers
p1288
aVnumber one geopolit foe
p1289
aVthank you bob mr presid folk at lynn univers good to be with you i m optimist about the futur i m excit about our prospect as a nation i want to see peac i want to see grow peac in this countri it s our object we have an opportun to have real leadership america is go to have that kind of leadership and continu to promot principl of peac that will make the world a safer place and make peopl in this countri more confid that their futur is secur
p1290
aVi also to want to make sure that we get this economi go and there are two veri differ path the countri can take one is a path repres by the presid which at the end of 4 year would mean we d have 20 trillion in debt head toward greec i ll get us on track to a balanc budget
p1291
aVthe presid s path will mean continu declin in take home pay i want to make sure our take home pay turn around and start to grow the presid s path mean 20 million peopl out of work struggl for a good job i ll get peopl back to work with 12 million new job
p1292
aVi m go to make sure that we get peopl off of food stamp not by cut the program but by get them good job america is go to come back and for that to happen we re go to have to have a presid who can work across the aisl
p1293
aVi was in a state where my legislatur was 87 percent democrat i learn how to get along on the other side of the aisl we ve got to do that in washington washington is broken i know what it take to get this countri back and we ll work with good democrat and good republican to do that
p1294
aVthis nation is the hope of the earth we ve been bless by have a nation that s free and prosper thank to the contribut of the greatest generat they ve held a torch for the world to see a torch of freedom and hope and opportun now it s our turn to take that torch i m convinc we ll do it
p1295
aVwe need strong leadership i d like to be that leader with your support i ll work with you i ll lead you in an open and honest way and i ask for your vote i d like to be the next presid of the unit state to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all togeth maintain america as the hope of the earth thank you so much
p1296
ag657
aVexcus me it s a geopolit foe and i said in the same paragraph i said and iran is the greatest nation secur threat we face russia doe continu to battl us in the u n time and time again i have clear eye on this i m not go to wear rose color glass when it come to russia or mr putin and i m certain not go to say to him i ll give you more flexibl after the elect after the elect he ll get more backbon
p1297
aVnumber two with regard to iraq you and i agre i believ that there should have been a status of forc agreement did you
p1298
aVthat s not true
p1299
aVoh you didn t you didn t want a status of forc agreement
p1300
aVno what i would not have done is left 10 000 troop in iraq that would tie us down that certain would not help us in the middl east
p1301
aVi m sorri you actual there was an effort on the part of the presid
p1302
aVhere is
p1303
aVhere is
p1304
aVand i concur in that and said that we should have some number of troop that stay on that was someth i concur with
p1305
aVgovernor
p1306
aVthat was your postur that was my postur as well you thought it should have been 5 000 troop
p1307
aVgovernor
p1308
aVi thought it should have been more troop but you know what the answer was
p1309
aVthis is just a few week ago
p1310
aVthis is just a few week ago that you indic that we should still have troop in iraq
p1311
aVno i didn t i m sorri that s
p1312
aVyou made a major speech
p1313
aVi indic that you fail to put in place a status of forc agreement
p1314
aVgovernor
p1315
aVgovernor here s one thing
p1316
aVhere s one thing i ve learn as command in chief you ve got to be clear both to our alli and our enemi about where you stand and what you mean now you just gave a speech a few week ago in which you said we should still have troop in iraq that is not a recip for make sure that we are take advantag of the opportun and meet the challeng of the middl east
p1317
aVnow it is absolut true that we cannot just beat these challeng militarili and so what i ve done throughout my presid and will continu to do is number one make sure that these countri are support our counterterror effort
p1318
aVnumber two make sure that they are stand by our interest in israel s secur becaus it is a true friend and our greatest alli in the region
p1319
aVnumber three we do have to make sure that we re protect religi minor and women becaus these countri can t develop unless all the popul not just half of it is develop
p1320
aVnumber four we do have to develop their econom capabl but number five the other thing that we have to do is recogn that we can t continu to do nation build in these region part of american leadership is make sure that we re do nation build here at home
p1321
aVthat will help us maintain the kind of american leadership that we need
p1322
aVwhat we ve done is organ the intern communiti say asad has to go we ve mobil sanction against that govern we have made sure that they are isol we have provid humanitarian assist and we are help the opposit organ and we re particular interest in make sure that we re mobil the moder forc insid of syria
p1323
aVbut ultim syrian are go to have to determin their own futur and so everyth we re do we re do in consult with our partner in the region includ israel which obvious has a huge interest in see what happen in syria coordin with turkey and other countri in the region that have a great interest in this
p1324
aVnow what we re see take place in syria is heartbreak and that s whi we are go to do everyth we can to make sure that we are help the opposit but we also have to recogn that for us to get more entangl militarili in syria is a serious step and we have to do so make absolut certain that we know who we are help that we re not put arm in the hand of folk who eventu could turn them against us or our alli in the region
p1325
aVand i am confid that asad s day are number but what we can t do is to simpli suggest that as governor romney at time has suggest that give heavi weapon for exampl to the syrian opposit is a simpl proposit that would lead us to be safer over the long term
p1326
aVwell let s step back and talk about what s happen in syria and how import it is first of all 30 000 peopl be kill by their govern is a humanitarian disast second syria is an opportun for us becaus syria play an import role in the middl east particular right now syria is iran s onli alli in the arab world it s their rout to the sea it s the rout for them to arm hizballah in lebanon which threaten of cours our alli israel and so see syria remov asad is a veri high prioriti for us number two see a replac govern be respons peopl is critic for us
p1327
aVthank you bob and thank you for agre to moder this debat this even thank you to lynn univers for welcom us here and mr presid it s good to be with you again we were togeth at a humor event a littl earlier and it s nice to mayb be funni this time not on purpos we ll see what happen
p1328
aVand final we don t want to have militari involv there we don t want to get drawn in to a militari conflict and so the right cours for us is work through our partner and with our own resourc to identifi respons parti within syria organ them bring them togeth in a form of if not govern a form of council that can take the lead in syria and then make sure they have the arm necessari to defend themselv
p1329
aVwe do need to make sure that they don t have arm that get into the wrong hand that those arm could be use to hurt us down the road we need to make sure as well that we coordin this effort with our alli and particular with israel but the saudi and the qatari and the turk are all veri concern about this they re will to work with us we need to have a veri effect leadership effort in syria make sure that the insurg there are arm and that the insurg that becom arm are peopl who will be the respons parti
p1330
aVrecogn i believ that asad must go i believ he will go but i believ we want to make sure that we have the relationship of friendship with the peopl that take his place such that in the year to come we see syria as a friend and syria as a respons parti in the middl east
p1331
aVthis is a critic opportun for america and what i m afraid of is what we ve watch over the past year or so first the presid say well we ll let the u n deal with it and asad excus me kofi annan came in and said we re go to tri to have a ceas fire that didn t work then it look to the russian and said let s see if you can do someth we should be play the leadership role there not on the ground with militari but play the leadership role
p1332
aVbob we are play the leadership role we organ the friend of syria we are mobil humanitarian support and support for the opposit and we are make sure that those we help are those who will be friend of our in the long term and friend of our alli in the region over the long term
p1333
aVbut go back to libya becaus this is an exampl of how we make choic when we went into libya and we were abl to immedi stop the massacr there becaus of the uniqu circumst and the coalit that we had help to organ we also had to make sure that muammar qaddafi didn t stay there
p1334
aVand to the governor s credit you support us go into libya and the coalit that we organ but when it came time to make sure that qaddafi did not stay in power that he was captur governor your suggest was that this was mission creep that this was mission muddl
p1335
aVimagin if we had pull out at that point muammar qaddafi had more american blood on his hand than ani individu other than usama bin laden and so we were go to make sure that we finish the job that s part of the reason whi the libyan stand with us but we did so in a care thought way make certain that we knew who we were deal with that those forc of moder on the ground were one that we could work with and we have to take the same kind of steadi thought leadership when it come to syria that s exact what we re do
p1336
aVthis is obvious an area of great concern to the entir world and to america in particular which is to see a complet chang in the structur and the environ in the middl east with the arab spring came a great deal of hope that there would be a chang toward more moder an opportun for greater particip on the part of women in public life and in econom life in the middl east but instead we ve seen in nation after nation a number of disturb event
p1337
aVi don t want to have our militari involv in syria i don t think there s a necess to put our militari in syria at this stage i don t anticip that in the futur as i indic our object are to replac asad and to have in place a new govern which is friend to us a respons govern if possibl and i want to make sure they get arm and they have the arm necessari to defend themselv but also to remov asad
p1338
aVbut i do not want to see a militari involv on the part of our troop and this isn t go to be necessari we have with our partner in the region we have suffici resourc to support those group
p1339
aVbut look this has been go on for a year this is a time this should have been a time for american leadership we should have taken a lead role not militarili but a lead role organiz government to bring togeth the parti there to find respons parti
p1340
aVas you hear from intellig sourc even today the insurg are high dispar they haven t come togeth they haven t form a uniti group a council of some kind that need to happen america can help that happen and we need to make sure they have the arm they need to carri out the veri import role which is get rid of asad
p1341
aVi ll be veri quick what you just heard governor romney said is he doesn t have differ idea and that s becaus we re do exact what we should be do to tri to promot a moder syrian leadership and an effect transit so that we get asad out that s the kind of leadership we ve shown that s the kind of leadership we ll continu to show
p1342
aVwhich i was not respons for i conclud it wasn t i wrote about that in my book
p1343
aVso is it presid obama s fault
p1344
aVbefor you even announc
p1345
aVis it presid obama s fault
p1346
aVlook there are differ
p1347
aVsecretari is it presid obama s fault
p1348
aVthere are
p1349
aVbecaus he s push it
p1350
aVthere are differ view about what s good for our countri our economi and our leadership in the world and i think it s import to look at what we need to do to get the economi go again that s whi i said new job with rise incom invest not in more tax cut that would add 5 trillion to the debt
p1351
aVbut you have no plan
p1352
aVbut in oh but i do
p1353
aVsecretari you have no plan
p1354
aVin fact i have written a book about it it s call stronger togeth you can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstor
p1355
aVthat s about all you ve
p1356
ag657
aVor at an airport near you
p1357
aVbut it s becaus i see this we need to have strong growth fair growth sustain growth we also have to look at how we help famili balanc the respons at home and the respons at busi
p1358
aVso we have a veri robust set of plan and peopl have look at both of our plan have conclud that mine would creat 10 million job and your would lose us 3 5 million job and explod the debt which would have a recess
p1359
aVwell thank you lester and thank to hofstra for host us
p1360
aVyou are go to approv one of the biggest tax cut in histori you are go to approv one of the biggest tax increas in histori you are go to drive busi out your regul are a disast and you re go to increas regul all over the place
p1361
aVand by the way my tax cut is the biggest sinc ronald reagan i m veri proud of it it will creat tremend number of new job but regul you are go to regul these busi out of exist
p1362
aVwhen i go around lester i tell you this i ve been all over and when i go around despit the tax cut the thing the thing that busi as in peopl like the most is the fact that i m cut regul you have regul on top of regul and new compani cannot form and old compani are go out of busi and you want to increas the regul and make them even wors
p1363
aVi m go to cut regul i m go to cut tax big leagu and you re go to rais tax big leagu end of stori
p1364
aVthat can t that can t be left to stand
p1365
aVi kind of assum that there would be a lot of these charg and claim and so
p1366
aVfact
p1367
aVso we have taken the home page of my websit hillaryclinton com and we ve turn it into a fact checker so if you want to see in real time what the fact are pleas go and take a look becaus what i have propos
p1368
aVthe central question in this elect is realli what kind of countri we want to be and what kind of futur we ll build togeth today is my granddaught s second birthday so i think about this a lot first we have to build an economi that work for everyon not just those at the top that mean we need new job good job with rise incom
p1369
aVand take a look at mine also and you ll see
p1370
aVwould not add a penni to the debt and your plan would add 5 trillion to the debt what i have propos would cut regul and streamlin them for small busi what i have propos would be paid for by rais tax on the wealthi becaus they have made all the gain in the economi and i think it s time that the wealthi and corpor paid their fair share to support this countri
p1371
aVwell could i just finish i think i
p1372
ag657
aVi think i should you go to her websit and you take a look at her websit
p1373
aVshe s go to rais tax 1 3 trillion
p1374
aVi want us to invest in you i want us to invest in your futur that mean job in infrastructur in advanc manufactur innov and technolog clean renew energi and small busi becaus most of the new job will come from small busi we also have to make the economi fairer that start with rais the nation minimum wage and also guarante final equal pay for women s work
p1375
aVand look at her websit you know what it s no differ than this she s tell us how to fight isi just go to her websit she tell you how to fight isi on her websit i don t think general dougla macarthur would like that too much
p1376
aVwell at least i have a plan to fight isi
p1377
aVno no you re tell the enemi everyth you want to do
p1378
aVno we re not no we re not
p1379
aVsee you re tell the enemi everyth you want to do no wonder you ve been fight no wonder you ve been fight isi your entir adult life
p1380
aVthat s a that s go to the pleas fact checker get to work
p1381
aVi also want to see more compani do profit share if you help creat the profit you should be abl to share in them not just the execut at the top
p1382
aVwell i m realli call for major job becaus the wealthi are go creat tremend job they re go to expand their compani they re go to do a tremend job
p1383
aVi m get rid of the carri interest provis and if you realli look it s not a tax it s realli not a great thing for the wealthi it s a great thing for the middl class it s a great thing for compani to expand
p1384
aVand when these peopl are go to put billion and billion of dollar into compani and when they re go to bring 2 5 trillion back from oversea where they can t bring the money back becaus politician like secretari clinton won t allow them to bring the money back becaus the tax are so oner and the bureaucrat red tape so what is so bad
p1385
aVso what they re do is they re leav our countri and they re believ it or not leav becaus tax are too high and becaus some of them have lot of money outsid of our countri and instead of bring it back and put the money to work becaus they can t work out a deal to and everybodi agre it should be brought back
p1386
aVinstead of that they re leav our countri to get their money becaus they can t bring their money back into our countri becaus of bureaucrat red tape becaus they can t get togeth becaus we have we have a presid that can t sit them around a tabl and get them to approv someth
p1387
aVand here s the thing republican and democrat agre that this should be done 2 5 trillion i happen to think it s doubl that it s probabl 5 trillion that we can t bring into our countri lester and with a littl leadership you d get it in here veri quick and it could be put to use on the inner citi and lot of other thing and it would be beauti
p1388
aVbut we have no leadership and honest that start with secretari clinton
p1389
aVi have a feel that by the end of this even i m go to be blame for everyth that s ever happen
p1390
aVwhi not
p1391
aVand i want us to do more to support peopl who are struggl to balanc famili and work i ve heard from so mani of you about the difficult choic you face and the stress that you re under so let s have paid famili leav earn sick day let s be sure we have afford child care and debt free colleg

aVyeah well let s start the clock again lester we ve look at your tax propos i don t see chang in the corpor tax rate or the kind of propos you re refer to that would caus the repatri bring back of money that s strand oversea i happen to support that
p1397
aVthen you didn t read it
p1398
aVi happen to i happen to support that in a way that will actual work to our benefit but when i look at what you have propos you have what is call now the trump loophol becaus it would so advantag you and the busi you do you ve propos an approach that has a
p1399
aVwho gave it that name the first i ve who gave it that name
p1400
ag657
aVhow are we go to do it we re go to do it by have the wealthi pay their fair share and close the corpor loophol

aVlester how much
p1405
aVas i said trump up trickl down trickl down did not work it got us into the mess we were in in 2008 and 2009 slash tax on the wealthi hasn t work
p1406
aVand a lot of realli smart wealthi peopl know that and they are say hey we need to do more to make the contribut we should be make to rebuild the middl class
p1407
aVi don t think top down work in america i think build the middl class invest in the middl class make colleg debt free so more young peopl can get their educ help peopl refin their their debt from colleg at a lower rate those are the kind of thing that will realli boost the economi broad base inclus growth is what we need in america not more advantag for peopl at the veri top
p1408
aVtypic politician all talk no action sound good doesn t work never go to happen our countri is suffer becaus peopl like secretari clinton have made such bad decis in term of our job and in term of what s go on
p1409
aVfinal we tonight are on the stage togeth donald trump and i donald it s good to be with you we re go to have a debat where we are talk about the import issu face our countri you have to judg us who can shoulder the immens awesom respons of the presid who can put into action the plan that will make your life better i hope that i will be abl to earn your vote on novemb 8th
p1410
aVnow look we have the worst reviv of an economi sinc the great depress and believ me we re in a bubbl right now and the onli thing that look good is the stock market but if you rais interest rate even a littl bit that s go to come crash down
p1411
aVwe are in a big fat ugli bubbl and we better be aw care and we have a fed that s do polit thing this janet yellen of the fed the fed is do polit by keep the interest rate at this level and believ me the day obama goe off and he leav and goe out to the golf cours for the rest of his life to play golf when they rais interest rate you re go to see some veri bad thing happen becaus the fed is not do their job the fed is be more polit than secretari clinton
p1412
aVi don t mind releas i m under a routin audit and it ll be releas and as soon as the audit s finish it will be releas
p1413
aVbut you will learn more about donald trump by go down to the feder elect where i file a 104 page essenti financi statement of sort the form that they have it show incom in fact the incom i just look today the incom is file at 694 million for this past year 694 million if you would have told me i was go to make that 15 or 20 year ago i would have been veri surpris
p1414
aVbut that s the kind of think that our countri need when we have a countri that s do so bad that s be rip off by everi singl countri in the world it s the kind of think that our countri need becaus everybodi lester we have a trade deficit with all of the countri that we do busi with of almost 800 billion a year you know what that is that mean who s negoti these trade deal
p1415
aVwe have peopl that are polit hack negoti our trade deal
p1416
aVexcus me
p1417
aVwell i told you i will releas them as soon as the audit look i ve been under audit almost for 15 year i know a lot of wealthi peopl that have never been audit i said do you get audit i get audit almost everi year
p1418
aVand in a way i should be complain i m not even complain i don t mind it it s almost becom a way of life i get audit by the ir but other peopl don t
p1419
aVi will say this we have a situat in this countri that has to be taken care of i will releas my tax return against my lawyer s wish when she releas her 33 000 e mail that have been delet as soon as she releas them i will releas
p1420
aVi will releas my tax return and that s against my lawyer they say don t do it i will tell you this no in fact watch show they re read the paper almost everi lawyer say you don t releas your return until the audit s complet when the audit s complet i ll do it but i would go against them if she releas her e mail
p1421
aVit s not negoti no let her releas the e mail whi did she delet 33 000
p1422
aVwell i think you ve seen anoth exampl of bait and switch here for 40 year everyon run for presid has releas their tax return you can go and see near i think 39 40 year of our tax return but everyon has done it we know the ir has made clear there is no prohibit on releas it when you re under audit
p1423
aVso you ve got to ask yourself whi won t he releas his tax return and i think there may be a coupl of reason first mayb he s not as rich as he say he is second mayb he s not as charit as he claim to be
p1424
aVthird we don t know all of his busi deal but we have been told through investig report that he owe about 650 million to wall street and foreign bank or mayb he doesn t want the american peopl all of you watch tonight to know that he s paid noth in feder tax becaus the onli year that anybodi s ever seen were a coupl of year when he had to turn them over to state author when he was tri to get a casino licens and they show he didn t pay ani feder incom tax
p1425
aVthat make me smart
p1426
aVso if he s paid zero that mean zero for troop zero for vet zero for school or health and i think probabl he s not all that enthusiast about have the rest of our countri see what the real reason are becaus it must be someth realli import even terribl that he s tri to hide
p1427
aVand the financi disclosur statement they don t give you the tax rate they don t give you all the detail that tax return would and it just seem to me that this is someth that the american peopl deserv to see and i have no reason to believ that he s ever go to releas his tax return becaus there s someth he s hide
p1428
aVand we ll guess we ll keep guess at what it might be that he s hide but i think the question is were he ever to get near the white hous what would be those conflict who doe he owe money to well he owe you the answer to that and he should provid them
p1429
aVi do you know i made a mistak use a privat e mail
p1430
aVthat s for sure
p1431
aVand if i had to do it over again i would obvious do it differ but i m not go to make ani excus it was a mistak and i take respons for that
p1432
aVthat was more than a mistak that was done purpos ok that was not a mistak that was done purpos when you have your staff take the fifth amend take the fifth so they re not prosecut when you have the man that set up the illeg server take the fifth i think it s disgrac and believ me this countri think it s realli think it s disgrac also
p1433
aVthank you lester our job are flee the countri they re go to mexico they re go to mani other countri you look at what china is do to our countri in term of make our product they re devalu their currenc and there s nobodi in our govern to fight them and we have a veri good fight and we have a win fight becaus they re use our countri as a piggi bank to rebuild china and mani other countri are do the same thing
p1434
aVas far as my tax return you don t learn that much from tax return that i can tell you you learn a lot from financi disclosur and you should go down and take a look at that
p1435
aVthe other thing i m extrem underleverag the report that said 650 which by the way a lot of friend of mine that know my busi say boy that s realli not a lot of money it s not a lot of money relat to what i had
p1436
aVthe build that were in question they said in the same report which was actual it wasn t even a bad stori to be honest with you but the build are worth 3 9 billion and the 650 isn t even on that but it s not 650 it s much less than that
p1437
aVbut i could give you a list of bank i would if that would help you i would give you a list of bank these are veri fine institut veri fine bank i could do that veri quick
p1438
aVi am veri underleverag i have a great compani i have a tremend incom and the reason i say that is not in a braggadocio way it s becaus it s about time that this countri had somebodi run it that has an idea about money
p1439
aVwhen we have 20 trillion in debt and our countri s a mess you know it s one thing to have 20 trillion in debt and our road are good and our bridg are good and everyth s in great shape our airport our airport are like from a third world countri
p1440
aVyou land at laguardia you land at kennedi you land at lax you land at newark and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incred you come in from china you see these incred airport and you land we ve becom a third world countri
p1441
aVso the worst of all thing has happen we owe 20 trillion and we re a mess we haven t even start and we ve spent 6 trillion in the middl east accord to a report that i just saw whether it s 6 or 5 but it look like it s 6 6 trillion in the middl east we could have rebuilt our countri twice
p1442
aVand it s realli a shame and it s politician like secretari clinton that have caus this problem our countri has tremend problem we re a debtor nation we re a serious debtor nation and we have a countri that need new road new tunnel new bridg new airport new school new hospit and we don t have the money becaus it s been squander on so mani of your idea
p1443
aVso we re lose our good job so mani of them when you look at what s happen in mexico a friend of mine who build plant said it s the eighth wonder of the world they re build some of the biggest plant anywher in the world some of the most sophist some of the best plant with the unit state as he said not so much
p1444
aVand mayb becaus you haven t paid ani feder incom tax for a lot of year
p1445
aVand the other thing i think is import
p1446
aVit would be squander too believ me
p1447
aVis if your if your main claim to be presid of the unit state is your busi then i think we should talk about that you know your campaign manag said that you built a lot of busi on the back of littl guy
p1448
aVand inde i have met a lot of the peopl who were stif by you and your busi donald i ve met dishwash painter architect glass instal marbl instal draperi instal like my dad was who you refus to pay when they finish the work that you ask them to do
p1449
aVwe have an architect in the audienc who design one of your clubhous at one of your golf cours it s a beauti facil it immedi was put to use and you wouldn t pay what the man need to be paid what he was charg you to do
p1450
aVmayb he didn t do a good job and i was unsatisfi with his work
p1451
aVwell to
p1452
aVwhich our countri should do too
p1453
aVdo the thousand of peopl that you have stif over the cours of your busi not deserv some kind of apolog from someon who has taken their labor taken the good that they produc and then refus to pay them
p1454
aVso ford is leav you see that their small car divis leav thousand of job leav michigan leav ohio they re all leav and we can t allow it to happen anymor as far as child care is concern and so mani other thing i think hillari and i agre on that we probabl disagre a littl bit as to number and amount and what we re go to do but perhap we ll be talk about that later
p1455
aVi can onli say that i m certain reliev that my late father never did busi with you he provid a good middl class life for us but the peopl he work for he expect the bargain to be kept on both side
p1456
aVand when we talk about your busi you ve taken busi bankruptci six time there are a lot of great businesspeopl that have never taken bankruptci onc you call yourself the king of debt you talk about leverag you even at one time suggest that you would tri to negoti down the nation debt of the unit state
p1457
aVwrong wrong
p1458
aVwell sometim there s not a direct transfer of skill from busi to govern but sometim what happen in busi would be realli bad for govern
p1459
aVand we need to be veri clear about that
p1460
aVso yeah i think i do think it s time look it s all word it s all sound bite i built an unbeliev compani some of the greatest asset anywher in the world real estat asset anywher in the world beyond the unit state in europ lot of differ place it s an unbeliev compani
p1461
aVbut on occas four time we use certain law that are there and when secretari clinton talk about peopl that didn t get paid first of all they did get paid a lot but taken advantag of the law of the nation
p1462
aVnow if you want to chang the law you ve been there a long time chang the law but i take advantag of the law of the nation becaus i m run a compani my oblig right now is to do well for myself my famili my employe for my compani and that s what i do
p1463
aVbut what she doesn t say is that ten of thousand of peopl that are unbeliev happi and that love me i ll give you an exampl we re just open up on pennsylvania avenu right next to the white hous so if i don t get there one way i m go to get to pennsylvania avenu anoth
p1464
aVbut we have to stop our job from be stolen from us we have to stop our compani from leav the unit state and with it fire all of their peopl all you have to do is take a look at carrier air condit in indianapoli they left fire 1 400 peopl they re go to mexico so mani hundr and hundr of compani are do this
p1465
aVbut we re open the old post offic under budget ahead of schedul save tremend money i m a year ahead of schedul and that s what this countri should be do
p1466
aVwe build road and they cost two and three and four time what they re suppos to cost we buy product for our militari and they come in at cost that are so far abov what they were suppos to be becaus we don t have peopl that know what they re do
p1467
aVwhen we look at the budget the budget is bad to a larg extent becaus we have peopl that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy the trump intern is way under budget and way ahead of schedul and we should be abl to do that for our countri
p1468
aVwell you re right race remain a signific challeng in our countri unfortun race still determin too much often determin where peopl live determin what kind of educ in their public school they can get and yes it determin how they re treat in the crimin justic system we ve just seen those two tragic exampl in both tulsa and charlott
p1469
aVand we ve got to do sever thing at the same time we have to restor trust between communiti and the polic we have to work to make sure that our polic are use the best train the best techniqu that they re well prepar to use forc onli when necessari everyon should be respect by the law and everyon should respect the law
p1470
aVright now that s not the case in a lot of our neighborhood so i have ever sinc the first day of my campaign call for crimin justic reform i ve laid out a platform that i think would begin to remedi some of the problem we have in the crimin justic system
p1471
aVbut we also have to recogn in addit to the challeng that we face with polic there are so mani good brave polic offic who equal want reform so we have to bring communiti togeth in order to begin work on that as a mutual goal and we ve got to get gun out of the hand of peopl who should not have them
p1472
aVwe cannot let it happen under my plan i ll be reduc tax tremend from 35 percent to 15 percent for compani small and big busi that s go to be a job creator like we haven t seen sinc ronald reagan it s go to be a beauti thing to watch
p1473
aVthe gun epidem is the lead caus of death of young african american men more than the next nine caus put togeth so we have to do two thing as i said we have to restor trust we have to work with the polic we have to make sure they respect the communiti and the communiti respect them and we have to tackl the plagu of gun violenc which is a big contributor to a lot of the problem that we re see today
p1474
aVwell first of all secretari clinton doesn t want to use a coupl of word and that s law and order and we need law and order if we don t have it we re not go to have a countri
p1475
aVand when i look at what s go on in charlott a citi i love a citi where i have invest when i look at what s go on throughout various part of our countri whether it s i mean i can just keep name them all day long we need law and order in our countri
p1476
aVi just got today the as you know the endors of the fratern order of polic we just just came in we have endors from i think almost everi polic group veri i mean a larg percentag of them in the unit state
p1477
aVwe have a situat where we have our inner citi african american hispan are live in he ll becaus it s so danger you walk down the street you get shot
p1478
aVin chicago they ve had thousand of shoot thousand sinc januari 1st thousand of shoot and i m say where is this is this a war torn countri what are we do and we have to stop the violenc we have to bring back law and order in a place like chicago where thousand of peopl have been kill thousand over the last number of year in fact almost 4 000 have been kill sinc barack obama becam presid over almost 4 000 peopl in chicago have been kill we have to bring back law and order
p1479
aVnow whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop and frisk which work veri well mayor giuliani is here work veri well in new york it brought the crime rate way down but you take the gun away from crimin that shouldn t be have it
p1480
aVwe have gang roam the street and in mani case they re illeg here illeg immigr and they have gun and they shoot peopl and we have to be veri strong and we have to be veri vigil
p1481
aVwe have to be we have to know what we re do right now our polic in mani case are afraid to do anyth we have to protect our inner citi becaus african american communiti are be decim by crime decim
p1482
aVcompani will come they will build they will expand new compani will start and i look veri veri much forward to do it we have to renegoti our trade deal and we have to stop these countri from steal our compani and our job
p1483
aVno you re wrong it went befor a judg who was a veri against polic judg it was taken away from her and our mayor our new mayor refus to go forward with the case they would have won an appeal if you look at it throughout the countri there are mani place where it s allow
p1484
aVno the argument is that we have to take the gun away from these peopl that have them and they are bad peopl that shouldn t have them
p1485
aVthese are felon these are peopl that are bad peopl that shouldn t be when you have 3 000 shoot in chicago from januari 1st when you have 4 000 peopl kill in chicago by gun from the begin of the presid of barack obama his hometown you have to have stop and frisk
p1486
aVyou need more polic you need a better communiti you know relat you don t have good communiti relat in chicago it s terribl i have properti there it s terribl what s go on in chicago
p1487
aVbut when you look and chicago s not the onli you go to ferguson you go to so mani differ place you need better relationship i agre with secretari clinton on this
p1488
aVyou need better relationship between the communiti and the polic becaus in some case it s not good
p1489
aVbut you look at dalla where the relationship were realli studi the relationship were realli a beauti thing and then five polic offic were kill one night veri violent so there s some bad thing go on some realli bad thing
p1490
aVbut we need lester we need law and order and we need law and order in the inner citi becaus the peopl that are most affect by what s happen are african american and hispan peopl and it s veri unfair to them what our politician are allow to happen
p1491
aVwell i ve heard i ve heard donald say this at his ralli and it s realli unfortun that he paint such a dire negat pictur of black communiti in our countri
p1492
aVugh
p1493
aVyou know the vibranc of the black church the black busi that employ so mani peopl the opportun that so mani famili are work to provid for their kid there s a lot that we should be proud of and we should be support and lift up
p1494
aVbut we do alway have to make sure we keep peopl safe there are the right way of do it and then there are way that are ineffect stop and frisk was found to be unconstitut and in part becaus it was ineffect it did not do what it need to do
p1495
aVnow i believ in communiti polic and in fact violent crime is one half of what it was in 1991 properti crime is down 40 percent we just don t want to see it creep back up we ve had 25 year of veri good cooper
p1496
aVbut there were some problem some unintend consequ too mani young african american and latino men end up in jail for nonviol offens and it s just a fact that if you re a young african american man and you do the same thing as a young white man you are more like to be arrest charg convict and incarcer so we ve got to address the system racism in our crimin justic system we cannot just say law and order we have to say we have to come forward with a plan that is go to divert peopl from the crimin justic system deal with mandatori minimum sentenc which have put too mani peopl away for too long for do too littl
p1497
aVwe need to have more second chanc program i m glad that we re end privat prison in the feder system i want to see them end in the state system you shouldn t have a profit motiv to fill prison cell with young american so there are some posit way we can work on this
p1498
aVand i believ strong that commonsens gun safeti measur would assist us right now and this is someth donald has support along with the gun lobbi right now we ve got too mani militari style weapon on the street in a lot of place our polic are outgun we need comprehens background check and we need to keep gun out of the hand of those who will do harm
p1499
aVwell i think that trade is an import issu of cours we are 5 percent of the world s popul we have to trade with the other 95 percent and we need to have smart fair trade deal
p1500
aVand we final need to pass a prohibit on anyon who s on the terrorist watch list from be abl to buy a gun in our countri if you re too danger to fli you are too danger to buy a gun so there are thing we can do and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way
p1501
aVlester i think implicit bias is a problem for everyon not just polic i think unfortun too mani of us in our great countri jump to conclus about each other and therefor i think we need all of us to be ask hard question about you know whi am i feel this way
p1502
aVbut when it come to polic sinc it can have liter fatal consequ i have said in my first budget we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retrain a lot of our polic offic
p1503
aVi ve met with a group of veri distinguish experienc polic chief a few week ago they admit it s an issu they ve got a lot of concern mental health is one of the biggest concern becaus now polic are have to handl a lot of realli difficult mental health problem on the street
p1504
aVthey want support they want more train they want more assist and i think the feder govern could be in a posit where we would offer and provid that
p1505
aVi d like to respond to that
p1506
aVfirst of all i agre and a lot of peopl even within my own parti want to give certain right to peopl on watch list and no fli list i agre with you when a person is on a watch list or a no fli list and i have the endors of the nra which i m veri proud of these are veri veri good peopl and they re protect the second amend
p1507
aVwe also though need to have a tax system that reward work and not just financi transact and the kind of plan that donald has put forth would be trickl down econom all over again in fact it would be the most extrem version the biggest tax cut for the top percent of the peopl in this countri than we ve ever had
p1508
aVbut i think we have to look veri strong at no fli list and watch list and when peopl are on there even if they shouldn t be on there we ll help them we ll help them legal we ll help them get off but i tend to agre with that quit strong
p1509
aVi do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the word super predat about young black youth and that s a term that i think was a it s it s been horribl met as you know i think you ve apolog for it but i think it was a terribl thing to say
p1510
aVand when it come to stop and frisk you know you re talk about take gun away well i m talk about take gun away from gang and peopl that use them and i don t think i realli don t think you disagre with me on this if you want to know the truth
p1511
aVi think mayb there s a polit reason whi you can t say it but i realli don t believ in new york citi stop and frisk we had 2 200 murder and stop and frisk brought it down to 500 murder five hundr murder is a lot of murder it s hard to believ 500 is like suppos to be good
p1512
aVbut we went from 2 200 to 500 and it was continu on by mayor bloomberg and it was termin by current mayor but stop and frisk had a tremend impact on the safeti of new york citi tremend beyond belief so when you say it has no impact it realli did it had a veri veri big impact
p1513
aVwell it s also fair to say if we re go to talk about mayor that under the current mayor crime has continu to drop includ murder so there is
p1514
aVno you re wrong you re wrong
p1515
aVno i m not
p1516
aVmurder are up all right you check it
p1517
aVnew york new york has done an excel job and i give credit i give credit across the board go back two mayor two polic chief becaus it has work and other communiti need to come togeth to do what will work as well
p1518
aVi call it trump up trickl down becaus that s exact what it would be that is not how we grow the economi
p1519
aVlook one murder is too mani but it is import that we learn about what has been effect and not go to thing that sound good that realli did not have the kind of impact that we would want who disagre with keep neighborhood safe
p1520
aVbut let s also add no one should disagre about respect the right of young men who live in those neighborhood and so we need to do a better job of work again with the communiti faith communiti busi communiti as well as the polic to tri to deal with this problem
p1521
aVi d like to just respond if i might
p1522
aVi d just like to respond
p1523
aVi will look the african american communiti has been let down by our politician they talk good around elect time like right now and after the elect they said see ya later i ll see you in four year
p1524
aVthe african american communiti becaus look the communiti within the inner citi has been so bad treat they ve been abus and use in order to get vote by democrat politician becaus that s what it is they ve control these communiti for up to 100 year
p1525
aVwe just have a differ view about what s best for grow the economi how we make invest that will actual produc job and rise incom
p1526
aVwell i i do think
p1527
aVand i will tell you you look at the inner citi and i just left detroit and i just left philadelphia and i just you know you ve seen me i ve been all over the place you decid to stay home and that s ok but i will tell you i ve been all over and i ve met some of the greatest peopl i ll ever meet within these communiti and they are veri veri upset with what their politician have told them and what their politician have done
p1528
aVi think i think i think donald just critic me for prepar for this debat and yes i did and you know what els i prepar for i prepar to be presid and i think that s a good thing
p1529
aVi ll tell you veri well just veri simpl to say sidney blumenth work for the campaign and close veri close friend of secretari clinton and her campaign manag patti doyl went to dure the campaign her campaign against presid obama fought veri hard and you can go look it up and you can check it out
p1530
aVand if you look at cnn this past week patti soli doyl was on wolf blitzer say that this happen blumenth sent mcclatchi high respect report at mcclatchi to kenya to find out about it they were press it veri hard she fail to get the birth certif
p1531
aVwhen i got involv i didn t fail i got him to give the birth certif so i m satisfi with it and i ll tell you whi i m satisfi with it
p1532
aVi think we come at it from somewhat differ perspect i understand that you know donald was veri fortun in his life and that s all to his benefit he start his busi with 14 million borrow from his father and he realli believ that the more you help wealthi peopl the better off we ll be and that everyth will work out from there
p1533
aVbecaus i want to get on to defeat isi becaus i want to get on to creat job becaus i want to get on to have a strong border becaus i want to get on to thing that are veri import to me and that are veri import to the countri
p1534
aVyeah
p1535
aVwell nobodi was press it nobodi was care much about it i figur you d ask the question tonight of cours but nobodi was care much about it but i was the one that got him to produc the birth certif and i think i did a good job
p1536
aVsecretari clinton also fought it i mean you know now everybodi in mainstream is go to say oh that s not true look it s true sidney blumenth sent a report you just have to take a look at cnn the last week the interview with your former campaign manag and she was involv but just like she can t bring back job she can t produc
p1537
aVwell it was veri i say noth i say noth becaus i was abl to get him to produc it he should have produc it a long time befor i say noth
p1538
aVi don t buy that i have a differ experi my father was a small businessman he work realli hard he print draperi fabric on long tabl where he pull out those fabric and he went down with a silkscreen and dump the paint in and took the squeege and kept go
p1539
aVbut let me just tell you when you talk about heal i think that i ve develop veri veri good relationship over the last littl while with the african american communiti i think you can see that
p1540
aVand i feel that they realli want me to come to that conclus and i think i did a great job and a great servic not onli for the countri but even for the presid in get him to produc his birth certif
p1541
aVwell just listen to what you heard
p1542
aVand clear as donald just admit he knew he was go to stand on this debat stage and lester holt was go to be ask us question so he tri to put the whole racist birther lie to bed
p1543
aVbut it can t be dismiss that easili he has realli start his polit activ base on this racist lie that our first black presid was not an american citizen there was absolut no evid for it but he persist he persist year after year becaus some of his support peopl that he was tri to bring into his fold appar believ it or want to believ it
p1544
aVbut rememb donald start his career back in 1973 be su by the justic depart for racial discrimin becaus he would not rent apart in one of his develop to african american and he made sure that the peopl who work for him understood that was the polici he actual was su twice by the justic depart
p1545
aVso he has a long record of engag in racist behavior and the birther lie was a veri hurt one you know barack obama is a man of great digniti and i could tell how much it bother him and annoy him that this was be tout and use against him
p1546
aVbut i like to rememb what michell obama said in her amaz speech at our democrat nation convent when they go low we go high and barack obama went high despit donald trump s best effort to bring him down
p1547
aVand so what i believ is the more we can do for the middl class the more we can invest in you your educ your skill your futur the better we will be off and the better we ll grow that s the kind of economi i want us to see again
p1548
aVi would love to respond first of all i got to watch in prepar for this some of your debat against barack obama you treat him with terribl disrespect and i watch the way you talk now about how love everyth is and how wonder you are it doesn t work that way you were after him you were tri to you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictur of him in a certain garb veri famous pictur i don t think you can deni that
p1549
aVbut just last week your campaign manag said it was true so when you tri to act holier than thou it realli doesn t work it realli doesn t
p1550
aVnow as far as the lawsuit yes when i was veri young i went into my father s compani had a real estat compani in brooklyn and queen and we along with mani mani other compani throughout the countri it was a feder lawsuit were su we settl the suit with zero with no admiss of guilt it was veri easi to do
p1551
aVi notic you bring that up a lot and you know i also notic the veri nasti commerci that you do on me in so mani differ way which i don t do on you mayb i m tri to save the money
p1552
aVbut frank i look i look at that and i say isn t that amaz becaus i settl that lawsuit with no admiss of guilt but that was a lawsuit brought against mani real estat firm and it s just one of those thing
p1553
aVi ll go one step further in palm beach florida tough communiti a brilliant communiti a wealthi communiti probabl the wealthiest communiti there is in the world i open a club and realli got great credit for it no discrimin against african american against muslim against anybodi and it s a tremend success club and i m so glad i did it and i have been given great credit for what i did and i m veri veri proud of it and that s the way i feel that is the true way i feel
p1554
aVwell i think cyber secur cyber warfar will be one of the biggest challeng face the next presid becaus clear we re face at this point two differ kind of adversari there are the independ hack group that do it most for commerci reason to tri to steal inform that they can use to make money
p1555
aVbut increas we are see cyber attack come from state organ of state the most recent and troubl of these has been russia there s no doubt now that russia has use cyber attack against all kind of organ in our countri and i am deepli concern about this i know donald s veri praiseworthi of vladimir putin but putin is play a realli
p1556
ag657
aVtough long game here and one of the thing he s done is to let loos cyber attack to hack into govern file to hack into person file hack into the democrat nation committe and we recent have learn that you know that this is one of their prefer method of tri to wreak havoc and collect inform we need to make it veri clear whether it s russia china iran or anybodi els the unit state has much greater capac and we are not go to sit idl by and permit state actor to go after our inform our privat sector inform or our public sector inform
p1557
aVand we re go to have to make it clear that we don t want to use the kind of tool that we have we don t want to engag in a differ kind of warfar but we will defend the citizen of this countri
p1558
aVand the russian need to understand that i think they ve been treat it as almost a probe how far would we go how much would we do and that s whi i was so i was so shock when donald public invit putin to hack into american that is just unaccept it s one of the reason whi 50 nation secur offici who serv in republican inform in administr
p1559
aVhave said that donald is unfit to be the command in chief it s comment like that that realli worri peopl who understand the threat that we face
p1560
aVi do want to say that i was just endors and more are come next week it will be over 200 admir mani of them here admir and general endors me to lead this countri that just happen and mani more are come and i m veri proud of it
p1561
aVin addit i was just endors by ice they ve never endors anybodi befor on immigr i was just endors by ice i was just recent endors 16 500 border patrol agent
p1562
aVso when secretari clinton talk about this i mean i ll take the admir and i ll take the general ani day over the polit hack that i see that have led our countri so brilliant over the last 10 year with their knowledg ok becaus look at the mess that we re in look at the mess that we re in
p1563
aVwell for one thing and befor we start on that my father gave me a veri small loan in 1975 and i built it into a compani that s worth mani mani billion of dollar with some of the greatest asset in the world and i say that onli becaus that s the kind of think that our countri need
p1564
aVas far as the cyber i agre to part of what secretari clinton said we should be better than anybodi els and perhap we re not i don t think anybodi know it was russia that broke into the dnc she s say russia russia russia but i don t mayb it was i mean it could be russia but it could also be china it could also be lot of other peopl it also could be somebodi sit on their bed that weigh 400 pound ok
p1565
aVyou don t know who broke in to dnc
p1566
aVbut what did we learn with dnc we learn that berni sander was taken advantag of by your peopl by debbi wasserman schultz look what happen to her but berni sander was taken advantag of that s what we learn
p1567
aVnow whether that was russia whether that was china whether it was anoth countri we don t know becaus the truth is under presid obama we ve lost control of thing that we use to have control over
p1568
aVwe came in with the internet we came up with the internet and i think secretari clinton and myself would agre veri much when you look at what isi is do with the internet they re beat us at our own game isi
p1569
aVso we have to get veri veri tough on cyber and cyber warfar it is it is a huge problem i have a son he s 10 year old he has comput he is so good with these comput it s unbeliev the secur aspect of cyber is veri veri tough and mayb it s hard doabl
p1570
aVbut i will say we are not do the job we should be do but that s true throughout our whole government societi we have so mani thing that we have to do better lester and certain cyber is one of them
p1571
aVwell i think there are a number of issu that we should be address i have put forth a plan to defeat isi it doe involv go after them onlin i think we need to do much more with our tech compani to prevent isi and their oper from be abl to use the internet to radic even direct peopl in our countri and europ and elsewher
p1572
aVbut we also have to intensifi our air strike against isi and eventu support our arab and kurdish partner to be abl to actual take out isi in raqqa end their claim of be a caliph
p1573
aVour countri s in deep troubl we don t know what we re do when it come to devalu and all of these countri all over the world especi china they re the best the best ever at it what they re do to us is a veri veri sad thing
p1574
aVwe re make progress our militari is assist in iraq and we re hope that within the year we ll be abl to push isi out of iraq and then you know realli squeez them in syria
p1575
aVbut we have to be cogniz of the fact that they ve had foreign fighter come to volunt for them foreign money foreign weapon so we have to make this the top prioriti
p1576
aVand i would also do everyth possibl to take out their leadership i was involv in a number of effort to take out al qaida leadership when i was secretari of state includ of cours take out bin laden and i think we need to go after baghdadi as well make that one of our organ principl becaus we ve got to defeat isi and we ve got to do everyth we can to disrupt their propaganda effort onlin
p1577
aVwell first i have to say one thing veri import secretari clinton is talk about take out isi we will take out isi well presid obama and secretari clinton creat a vacuum the way they got out of iraq becaus they got out what they shouldn t have been in but onc they got in the way they got out was a disast and isi was form
p1578
aVso she talk about take them out she s been do it a long time she s been tri to take them out for a long time but they wouldn t have even been form if they left some troop behind like 10 000 or mayb someth more than that and then you wouldn t have had them
p1579
aVor as i ve been say for a long time and i think you ll agre becaus i said it to you onc had we taken the oil and we should have taken the oil isi would not have been abl to form either becaus the oil was their primari sourc of incom and now they have the oil all over the place includ the oil a lot of the oil in libya which was anoth one of her disast
p1580
aVwell i hope the fact checker are turn up the volum and realli work hard donald support the invas of iraq
p1581
aVwrong
p1582
aVso we have to do that we have to renegoti our trade deal and lester they re take our job they re give incent they re do thing that frank we don t do
p1583
aVthat is absolut prove over and over again
p1584
aVwrong wrong
p1585
aVhe actual advoc for the action we took in libya and urg that gadhafi be taken out after actual do some busi with him one time
p1586
aVbut the larger point and he say this constant is georg w bush made the agreement about when american troop would leav iraq not barack obama
p1587
aVand the onli way that american troop could have stay in iraq is to get an agreement from the then iraqi govern that would have protect our troop and the iraqi govern would not give that
p1588
aVbut let s talk about the question you ask lester the question you ask is what do we do here in the unit state that s the most import part of this how do we prevent attack how do we protect our peopl
p1589
aVand i think we ve got to have an intellig surg where we are look for everi scrap of inform i was so proud of law enforc in new york in minnesota in new jersey you know they respond so quick so profession to the attack that occur by rahami and they brought him down and we may find out more inform becaus he is still aliv which may prove to be an intellig benefit
p1590
aVso we ve got to do everyth we can to vacuum up intellig from europ from the middl east that mean we ve got to work more close with our alli and that s someth that donald has been veri dismiss of
p1591
aVwe re work with nato the longest militari allianc in the histori of the world to realli turn our attent to terror we re work with our friend in the middl east mani of which as you know are muslim major nation donald has consist insult muslim abroad muslim at home when we need to be cooper with muslim nation and with the american muslim communiti
p1592
aVthey re on the front line they can provid inform to us that we might not get anywher els they need to have close work cooper with law enforc in these communiti not be alien and push away as some of donald s rhetor unfortun has led to
p1593
aVlet me give you the exampl of mexico they have a vat tax we re on a differ system when we sell into mexico there s a tax when they sell in automat 16 percent approxim when they sell into us there s no tax it s a defect agreement it s been defect for a long time mani year but the politician haven t done anyth about it
p1594
aVwell i have to respond
p1595
aVthe secretari said veri strong about work with we ve been work with them for mani year and we have the greatest mess anyon s ever seen you look at the middl east it s a total mess under your direct to a larg extent
p1596
aVbut you look at the middl east you start the iran deal that s anoth beauti where you have a countri that was readi to fall i mean they were do so bad they were choke on the sanction and now they re go to be actual probabl a major power at some point pretti soon the way they re go
p1597
aVbut when you look at nato i was ask on a major show what do you think of nato and you have to understand i m a businessperson i did realli well but i have common sens and i said well i ll tell you i haven t given lot of thought to nato but two thing
p1598
aVnumber one the 28 countri of nato mani of them aren t pay their fair share number two and that bother me becaus we should be ask we re defend them and they should at least be pay us what they re suppos to be pay by treati and contract
p1599
aVand number two i said and veri strong nato could be obsolet becaus and i was veri strong on this and it was actual cover veri accur in the new york time which is unusu for the new york time to be honest but i said they do not focus on terror and i was veri strong and i said it numer time
p1600
aVand about four month ago i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is open up a major terror divis and i think that s great and i think we should get becaus we pay approxim 73 percent of the cost of nato it s a lot of money to protect other peopl but i m all for nato but i said they have to focus on terror also
p1601
aVand they re go to do that and that was believ me i m sure i m not go to get credit for it but that was larg becaus of what i was say and my critic of nato
p1602
aVnow in all fair to secretari clinton yes is that ok good i want you to be veri happi it s veri import to me
p1603
aVi think we have to get nato to go into the middl east with us in addit to surround nation and we have to knock the hell out of isi and we have to do it fast when isi form in this vacuum creat by barack obama and secretari clinton and believ me you were the one that took out the troop not onli that you name the day they couldn t believ it they sat back probabl and said i can t believ it they said
p1604
aVlester we ve cover
p1605
aVno wait a minut
p1606
aVwe ve cover this ground
p1607
aVwhen they form when they form this is someth that never should have happen it should have never happen now you re talk about take out isi but you were there and you were secretari of state when it was a littl infant now it s in over 30 countri and you re go to stop them i don t think so
p1608
aVi did not support the war in iraq
p1609
aVthat is a mainstream media nonsens put out by her becaus she frank i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media
p1610
aVbut in all fair to secretari clinton when she start talk about this it was realli veri recent she s been do this for 30 year and whi hasn t she made the agreement better the nafta agreement is defect just becaus of the tax and mani other reason but just becaus of the fact
p1611
aVjust would you like to hear
p1612
aVwait a minut i was against the war in iraq just so you put it out
p1613
aVthe record doe not show that
p1614
aVthe record show that i m right when i did an interview with howard stern veri light first time anyon s ask me that i said veri light i don t know mayb who know essenti i then did an interview with neil cavuto we talk about the economi is more import i then spoke to sean hanniti which everybodi refus to call sean hanniti i had numer convers with sean hanniti at fox and sean hanniti said and he call me the other day and i spoke to him about it he said you were total against the war becaus he was for the war
p1615
aVand when he excus me and that was befor the war start sean hanniti said veri strong to me and other peopl he s will to say it but nobodi want to call him i was against the war he said you use to have fight with me becaus sean was in favor of the war
p1616
aVand i understand that side also not veri much becaus we should have never been there but nobodi call sean hanniti and then they did an articl in a major magazin short after the war start i think in 04 but they did an articl which had me total against the war in iraq
p1617
aVand one of your compatriot said you know whether it was befor or right after trump was definit becaus if you read this articl there s no doubt but if somebodi and i ll ask the press if somebodi would call up sean hanniti this was befor the war start he and i use to have argument about the war i said it s a terribl and a stupid thing it s go to destabil the middl east and that s exact what it s done it s been a disast
p1618
aVno no you didn t hear what i said
p1619
aVwell i have much better judgment than she doe there s no question about that i also have a much better tempera than she has you know
p1620
aVi have a much better she spent let me tell you she spent hundr of million of dollar on an advertis you know they get madison avenu into a room they put name oh tempera let s go after i think my strongest asset mayb by far is my tempera i have a win tempera i know how to win she doe not have a
p1621
aVwait the afl cio the other day behind the blue screen i don t know who you were talk to secretari clinton but you were total out of control i said there s a person with a tempera that s got a problem
p1622
aVwhew ok
p1623
aVsecretari clinton and other politician should have been do this for year not right now becaus of the fact that we ve creat a movement they should have been do this for year what s happen to our job and our countri and our economi general is look we owe 20 trillion we cannot do it ani longer lester
p1624
aVlet s talk about two import issu that were briefli mention by donald first nato you know nato as a militari allianc has someth call articl 5 and basic it say this an attack on one is an attack on all and you know the onli time it s ever been invok after 9 11 when the 28 nation of nato said that they would go to afghanistan with us to fight terror someth that they still are do by our side
p1625
aVwith respect to iran when i becam secretari of state iran was week away from have enough nuclear materi to form a bomb they had master the nuclear fuel cycl under the bush administr they had built covert facil they had stock them with centrifug that were whirl away
p1626
aVand we had sanction them i vote for everi sanction against iran when i was in the senat but it wasn t enough so i spent a year and a half put togeth a coalit that includ russia and china to impos the toughest sanction on iran
p1627
aVand we did drive them to the negoti tabl and my successor john kerri and presid obama got a deal that put a lid on iran s nuclear program without fire a singl shot that s diplomaci that s coalit build that s work with other nation
p1628
aVthe other day i saw donald say that there were some iranian sailor on a ship in the water off of iran and they were taunt american sailor who were on a nearbi ship he said you know if they taunt our sailor i d blow them out of the water and start anoth war that s not good judgment
p1629
aVthat would not start a war
p1630
aVthat is not the right tempera to be command in chief to be taunt and the worst part
p1631
aVno they were taunt us
p1632
aVof what we heard donald say has been about nuclear weapon he has said repeat that he didn t care if other nation got nuclear weapon japan south korea even saudi arabia it has been the polici of the unit state democrat and republican to do everyth we could to reduc the prolifer of nuclear weapon he even said well you know if there were nuclear war in east asia well you know that s fine
p1633
aVwrong
p1634
aVhave a good time folk
p1635
aVit s lie
p1636
aVand in fact his cavali attitud about nuclear weapon is so deepli troubl that is the number one threat we face in the world and it becom particular threaten if terrorist ever get their hand on ani nuclear materi so a man who can be provok by a tweet should not have his finger anywher near the nuclear code as far as i think anyon with ani sens about this should be concern
p1637
aVthat line s get a littl bit old i must say i would like to
p1638
aVit s a good one though it well describ the problem
p1639
aVit s not an accur one at all it s not an accur one so i just want to give a lot of thing and just to respond i agre with her on one thing the singl greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament nuclear weapon not global warm like you think and your your presid think
p1640
aVnuclear is the singl greatest threat just to go down the list we defend japan we defend germani we defend south korea we defend saudi arabia we defend countri they do not pay us but they should be pay us becaus we are provid tremend servic and we re lose a fortun that s whi we re lose we re lose we lose on everyth i say who make these we lose on everyth all i said that it s veri possibl that if they don t pay a fair share becaus this isn t 40 year ago where we could do what we re do we can t defend japan a behemoth sell us car by the million
p1641
aVwell wait but it s veri import all i said was they may have to defend themselv or they have to help us out we re a countri that owe 20 trillion they have to help us out
p1642
aVwell the first thing you do is don t let the job leav the compani are leav i could name i mean there are thousand of them they re leav and they re leav in bigger number than ever
p1643
aVas far as the nuclear is concern i agre it is the singl greatest threat that this countri has
p1644
aVwell i have to say that you know for what secretari clinton was say about nuclear with russia she s veri cavali in the way she talk about various countri but russia has been expand their they have a much newer capabl than we do we have not been updat from the new standpoint
p1645
aVi look the other night i was see b 52s they re old enough that your father your grandfath could be fli them we are not we are not keep up with other countri i would like everybodi to end it just get rid of it but i would certain not do first strike
p1646
aVi think that onc the nuclear altern happen it s over at the same time we have to be prepar i can t take anyth off the tabl becaus you look at some of these countri you look at north korea we re do noth there china should solv that problem for us china should go into north korea china is total power as it relat to north korea
p1647
aVand by the way anoth one power is the worst deal i think i ve ever seen negoti that you start is the iran deal iran is one of their biggest trade partner iran has power over north korea
p1648
aVand when they made that horribl deal with iran they should have includ the fact that they do someth with respect to north korea and they should have done someth with respect to yemen and all these other place
p1649
aVand when ask to secretari kerri whi didn t you do that whi didn t you add other thing into the deal one of the great giveaway of all time of all time includ 400 million in cash nobodi s ever seen that befor that turn out to be wrong it was actual 1 7 billion in cash obvious i guess for the hostag it certain look that way
p1650
aVso you say to yourself whi didn t they make the right deal this is one of the worst deal ever made by ani countri in histori the deal with iran will lead to nuclear problem all they have to do is sit back 10 year and they don t have to do much
p1651
aVand what you do is you say fine you want to go to mexico or some other countri good luck we wish you a lot of luck but if you think you re go to make your air condition or your car or your cooki or whatev you make and bring them into our countri without a tax you re wrong
p1652
aVand they re go to end up get nuclear i met with bibi netanyahu the other day believ me he s not a happi camper
p1653
aVwell let me let me start by say word matter word matter when you run for presid and they realli matter when you are presid and i want to reassur our alli in japan and south korea and elsewher that we have mutual defens treati and we will honor them
p1654
aVit is essenti that america s word be good and so i know that this campaign has caus some question and worri on the part of mani leader across the globe i ve talk with a number of them but i want to on behalf of myself and i think on behalf of a major of the american peopl say that you know our word is good
p1655
aVit s also import that we look at the entir global situat there s no doubt that we have other problem with iran but person i d rather deal with the other problem have put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be face that
p1656
aVand donald never tell you what he would do would he have start a war would he have bomb iran if he s go to critic a deal that has been veri success in give us access to iranian facil that we never had befor then he should tell us what his altern would be but it s like his plan to defeat isi he say it s a secret plan but the onli secret is that he has no plan
p1657
aVso we need to be more precis in how we talk about these issu peopl around the word follow our presidenti campaign so close tri to get hint about what we will do can they reli on us are we go to lead the world with strength and in accord with our valu that s what i intend to do i intend to be a leader of our countri that peopl can count on both here at home and around the world to make decis that will further peac and prosper but also stand up to bulli whether they re abroad or at home
p1658
aVwe cannot let those who would tri to destabil the world to interfer with american interest and secur
p1659
aVto be given ani opportun at all
p1660

p1693
aV200 million is spent and i m either win or tie and i ve spent practic noth
p1694
aVwell i support our democraci and sometim you win sometim you lose but i certain will support the outcom of this elect
p1695
aVand i know donald s tri veri hard to plant doubt about it but i hope the peopl out there understand this elect s realli up to you it s not about us so much as it is about you and your famili and the kind of countri and futur you want so i sure hope you will get out and vote as though your futur depend on it becaus i think it doe
p1696

aVlook here s the stori i want to make america great again i m go to be abl to do it i don t believ hillari will the answer is if she win i will absolut support her
p1700
aVnow we have come back from that abyss and it has not been easi so we re now on the precipic of have a potenti much better economi but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the polici that fail us in the first place
p1701
aVindepend expert have look at what i ve propos and look at what donald s propos and basic they ve said this that if his tax plan which would blow up the debt by over 5 trillion and would in some instanc disadvantag middl class famili compar to the wealthi were to go into effect we would lose 3 5 million job and mayb have anoth recess
p1702

p1711
aVthe obama administr from the time they ve come in is over 230 year worth of debt and he s top it he s doubl it in a cours of almost eight year seven and a half year to be semi exact
p1712
aVso i will tell you this we have to do a much better job at keep our job and we have to do a much better job at give compani incent to build new compani or to expand becaus they re not do it

p1796
aVwe have to keep it solvent and we will keep it solvent and we ll look for strategi like adjust the payrol tax cap upward in order to do that
p1797
aVhere s what hillari and i will not do and i want to make this veri plain we will never ever engag in a riski scheme to privat social secur donald trump wrote a book and he said social secur is a ponzi scheme and privat would be good for all of us

p1807
aVi
p1808
aVand senat kain it s an honor to be here with you as well and i just i also want to say i want to say thank to everyon that s look in tonight who understand what an enorm import time this is in the life of our nation
p1809
aVthere s a question that you ask a littl bit earlier that i want to go back to
p1810
aVi can t believ that you won t defend your own vote record
p1811
aVi have to go back to
p1812
aVwell look i you re run with hillari clinton who want to rais tax by 1 trillion increas spend by 2 trillion and you say you re go to keep the promis of social secur donald trump and i are go to cut tax we re go to we re go to we re go to
p1813
aVyou re not go to cut tax you re go to rais tax on the middl class
p1814
aVreform govern program so we can meet the oblig of social secur and medicar
p1815
aVyou did ask this question about debt and the debt explos on the trump plan is much much bigger than anyth on the clinton side
p1816
aVfor the last seven and a half year we ve seen america s place in the world weaken we ve seen an economi stifl by more tax more regul a war on coal and a fail health care reform come to be known as obamacar and the american peopl know that we need to make a chang and so i want to thank all of you for be be with us tonight
p1817
aVthree hundr and five economist said your plan is bad for the economi
p1818
aVelain i think that s a veri fair comment i think we put a lot on polic shoulder and this is someth i got a lot of scar tissu and experi on
p1819
aVi was a citi councilman and mayor in richmond and when i came in we had one of the highest homicid rate in the unit state we fought veri veri hard over the cours of my time in local offic with our polic depart and we reduc our homicid rate near in half
p1820
aVand then when i was governor of virginia we work hard too and we did someth we had realli want to do for the first time ever we crack the top 10 10 safest state becaus we work togeth
p1821
aVhere s what i learn as a mayor and a governor the way you make communiti safer and the way you make polic safer is through communiti polic you build the bond between the communiti and the polic forc build bond of understand and then when peopl feel comfort in their communiti that gap between the polic and the communiti they serv narrow and when that gap narrow it s safer for the communiti and it s safer for the polic
p1822
aVthat model still work across our countri but there are some other model that don t work an over aggress more militar model donald trump recent said we need to do more stop and frisk around the countri that would be a big mistak becaus it polar the relationship between the polic and the communiti
p1823
aVso here s what we ll do we ll focus on communiti polic we will focus on and hillari clinton has roll out a realli comprehens mental health reform packag that she work on with law enforc profession and we will also fight the scourg of gun violenc in the unit state
p1824
aVi also want to thank donald trump for make that call and invit us to be a part of this ticket i have to tell you i m a i m a small town boy from a place not too differ from farmvill i grew up with a cornfield in my backyard my grandfath had immigr to this countri when he was about my son s age my mom and dad built a everyth that matter in a small town in southern indiana they built a famili and and a good name and a busi and they rais a famili and i dream some day of repres my home town in washington d c but i honest elain i never imagin never imagin i d have the opportun to be governor of the state that i love let alon be sit at a tabl like this in this kind of a posit
p1825
aVi m a gun owner i m a strong second amend support but i ve got a lot of scar tissu becaus when i was governor of virginia there was a horribl shoot at virginia tech and we learn that through that pain situat that gap in the background record check system should have been close and it could have prevent that crime and so we re go to work to do thing like close background record check and if we do we won t have the tragedi that we did
p1826
aVone of those kill at virginia tech was a guy name liviu librescu he was a 70 plus year old romanian holocaust survivor he had surviv the holocaust then he surviv the soviet union takeov of his countri but then he was a visit professor at virginia tech and he couldn t surviv the scourg of gun violenc
p1827
aVwe can support the second amend and do thing like background record check and make us safer and that will make polic safer too
p1828
aVyou know my uncl was a cop a career cop on the beat in downtown chicago he was my hero when i was grow up and we d go up to visit my dad s famili in chicago my three brother and i would marvel at my uncl when he would come out in his uniform sidearm at his side
p1829
aVpolic offic are the best of us and the men and women white african american asian latino hispan they put their live on the line everi singl day and let my say at the risk of agre with you communiti polic is a great idea it s work in the hoosier state and we fulli support that
p1830
aVdonald trump and i are go to make sure that law enforc have the resourc and the tool to be abl to realli restor law and order to the citi and communiti in this nation it s probabl probabl whi the 330 000 member of the fratern order of polic endors donald trump as the next presid of the unit state of america becaus they see his commit to them they see his commit to law and order
p1831
aVbut they also they also hear the bad mouth the bad mouth that come from peopl that seiz upon tragedi in the wake of polic action shoot as as a reason to to use a broad brush to accus law enforc of of implicit bias or institut racism and that realli has got to stop
p1832
aVi mean when an african american polic offic in charlott name brentley vinson an all star footbal player who went to liberti univers here in the state came home follow his dad into law enforc join the forc in charlott join the forc in charlott in 2014 was involv in a polic action shoot that claim the life of keith keith lamont scott it was a tragedi i mean i we we mourn with those who mourn we we griev with those who griev and we re sadden at the loss of life
p1833
aVbut hillari clinton actual refer to that moment as an exampl of implicit bias in the polic forc where where she use when she was ask in the debat a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforc her onli answer was that there s implicit bias in everyon in the unit state i just think
p1834
aVso to answer your question i would say i i would hope that if if the respons ever fell to me in this role that i would meet it with the way that i m go to meet the respons should i be elect vice presid of the unit state and that s to bring a lifetim of experi a lifetim grow up in a small town a lifetim where i ve serv in the congress of the unit state where where i ve led a state that work in the great state of indiana and whatev other respons might follow from this i i would hope and frank i would pray to be abl to meet that moment with that that lifetim of experi
p1835
aVcan i can i explain
p1836
aVi just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seiz on these moment of tragedi we ought to assur the public that we ll have a full and complet and transpar investig whenev there s a loss of life becaus of polic action but senat pleas you know enough of this seek everi opportun to demean law enforc broad by make the accus of implicit bias everi time tragedi occur
p1837
aVelain elain peopl shouldn t be afraid to bring up issu of bias in law enforc and if you re afraid to have
p1838
aVi m not afraid to bring that up
p1839
aVand if if you re afraid to have the discuss you ll never solv it and so here s here s an exampl heartbreak we would agre this was a heartbreak exampl
p1840
aVthe guy philando castil who was kill in st paul he was a worker a valu worker in a local school and he was kill for no appar reason in an incid that will be discuss and will be investig
p1841
aVbut when folk went and explor this situat what they found is that philando castil who was a they call him mr roger with dreadlock in the school that he work the kid love him but he had been stop by polic 40 or 50 time befor that fatal incid and if you look at sentenc in this countri african american and latino get sentenc for the same crime at veri differ rate
p1842
aVwe need crimin justic reform
p1843
aVwell we do
p1844
aVindiana has pass crimin justic reform
p1845
aVbut i just want to say those who say that we should not
p1846
aVbut that s not what you re talk about
p1847
aVwe should not be abl to bring up and talk about bias in the system we ll never solv the problem
p1848
aVsenat when african american polic offic involv in a polic action shoot involv an african american whi would hillari clinton accus that african american polic offic of implicit bias
p1849
aVwell i guess i can t believ you are defend the posit that there is no bias and it s a topic we don t even
p1850
aVi did not make that statement i
p1851
aVa u s senat
p1852
aVelain let me tell you whi i trust hillari clinton here s what peopl should look at as they look at a public servant do they have a passion in their life that show up befor they were in public life and have they held onto that passion throughout their life regardless of whether they were in offic or not succeed or fail
p1853
aVwell i have the deepest respect for senat scott and he s a close friend and what i would say is that we we need to adopt crimin justic reform nation i i sign crimin justic reform in the state of indiana senat and we re veri proud of it
p1854
aVi work when i was congress on a second chanc act we have got to do a better job recogn and correct the error in the system that do reflect on institut bias in crimin justic but what what what donald trump and i are say is let s not have the reflex of assum the worst of men and women in law enforc we truli do believ that law enforc is not a forc for racism or divis in our countri
p1855
aVelain can i
p1856
aVlaw enforc in this countri is a forc for good they are the they truli are peopl that put their live on the line everi singl day but i would i would suggest to you what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the nation level to support law enforc you just heard senat kain reject stop and frisk well i would suggest to you that the famili that live in our inner citi that are besieg by crime
p1857
aVelain let me let me
p1858
aVelain if i could if i could jump in i ve heard senat scott make that eloqu plea and look crimin justic is about respect the law and be respect by the law so there is a fundament respect issu here
p1859
aVand i just want to talk about the tone that s set from the top donald trump dure his campaign has call mexican rapist and crimin he s call women slob pig dog disgust i don t like say that in front of my wife and my mother he attack an indiana born feder judg and said he was unqualifi to hear a feder lawsuit becaus his parent were mexican he went after john mccain a pow and said he wasn t hero becaus he d been captur he said african american are live in hell and he perpetr this outrag and bigot lie that presid obama is not a u s citizen
p1860
aVhillari clinton has that passion from a time as a kid in a methodist youth group in the suburb of chicago she has been focus on serv other with a special focus on empow famili and kid as a civil right lawyer in the south with the children s defens fund first ladi of arkansa and this countri senat secretari of state it s alway been about put other first and that s a sharp contrast with donald trump
p1861
aVif you want to have a societi where peopl are respect and respect law you can t have somebodi at the top who demean everi group that he talk about and i just again i cannot believ that governor penc will defend the insult driven campaign that donald trump has run
p1862
aVdonald trump s laid out a plan to end illeg immigr onc and for all in this countri we ve been talk it to death for 20 year hillari clinton and tim kain want to continu the polici of open border amnesti catch and releas sanctuari citi all the thing that are drive that are drive wage down in this countri senat and also too often with crimin alien in the countri it s bring heartbreak
p1863
aVbut i donald trump has a plan that he laid out in arizona that will deal system with illeg immigr begin with border secur intern enforc it s probabl whi for the first time in the histori of immigr and custom enforc their union actual endors donald trump as the next presid of the unit state becaus they know they need help to enforc the law of this countri
p1864
aVand donald trump has laid out a prioriti to remov crimin alien remov peopl that have overstay their visa and and onc we have accomplish all of that which will which will strengthen our economi strengthen the rule of law in the countri and make our communiti safer onc the crimin alien are out then we ll deal with those that remain

p1869
aVthank i forgiv you he say our is an insult driven campaign did you all just hear that our is an insult driven campaign
p1870
aVi mean to be honest with you if donald trump had said all of the thing that you ve said he said in the way you said he said them he still wouldn t have a fraction of the insult that hillari clinton level when she said that half of our support were a basket of deplor it s she said they were irredeem they were not american
p1871
aVi mean it s extraordinari and then she label one after anoth ism on million of american who believ that we can have a stronger america at home and abroad who believ we can get this economi move again who believ that we can end illeg immigr onc and for all so senat this this insult driven campaign i mean

p1874
aVhillari clinton said someth on the campaign trail and the veri next day she said you know what i shouldn t have said that
p1875
aVshe said she shouldn t have said half
p1876
aVit is so pain to suggest that we go back to think about these day where an african american could not be a citizen of the unit state and i can t imagin how governor penc can defend the insult driven selfish me first style of donald trump

p1895
aVno i
p1896
aVwell let me let me say first and foremost that senat you and hillari clinton would know a lot about an insult driven campaign it realli is remark at a time when liter in the wake of hillari clinton s tenur as secretari of state where she was the architect of the obama administr s foreign polici we see entir portion of the world particular the wider middl east liter spin out of control i mean the situat we re watch hour by hour in syria today is the result of the fail foreign polici and the weak foreign polici that hillari clinton help lead in this administr and creat the newli embolden the aggress of russia whether it was in ukrain or now they re heavi hand approach

p1899
aVronald reagan said a nation without border is not a nation donald trump is commit to restor the border of this nation and secur our nation enforc our law
p1900
aVwell i think donald trump laid out a seri of prioriti that doesn t end with border secur it begin with border secur and after we secur the border not onli build a wall but beneath the ground and in the air we do intern enforc
p1901
aVbut he said the focus has to be on crimin alien we just we just had a convers about law enforc we just had a convers about the the violenc that s beset our citi the realiti is that there s heartbreak and tragedi that has struck american famili becaus peopl that came into this countri illeg are now involv in crimin enterpris and activ and we don t have the resourc or the will to deport them system
p1902
aVdonald trump has said we re go to move those peopl out peopl who ve overstay their visa we re go to enforc the law of this countri we re go to strengthen immigr and custom enforc with more resourc and more personnel to be abl to do that and then donald trump has made it clear onc we ve done all of those thing that we re go to reform the immigr system that we have

p1911
aVwhen donald trump say mexican are rapist and crimin mexican immigr when donald trump say about your judg a hoosier judg he said that judg curiel was unqualifi to hear a case becaus his parent were mexican i can t imagin how you could defend that
p1912
aVthe terrorist threat has decreas in some way becaus bin laden is dead the terrorist threat has decreas in some way becaus an iranian nuclear weapon program has been stop the terrorist threat to unit state troop has been decreas in some way becaus there s not 175 000 in a danger part of the world there s onli 15 000
p1913
aVbut there are other part of the world that are challeng let me tell you this to beat terror there s onli one candid who can do it and it s hillari clinton rememb hillari clinton was the senat from new york on 9 11 she was there at the world trade center when they were still search for victim and survivor that s sear onto her the need to beat terror

aVtheir heavi hand approach
p1916
aVsecond we ve got to disrupt financ network third disrupt their abil to recruit on the internet in their safe haven but fourth we also have to work with alli to share and surg intellig that s the hillari clinton plan she s got the experi to do it
p1917
aVdonald trump donald trump can t start a twitter war with miss univers without shoot himself in the foot donald trump doesn t have a plan he said i have a secret plan and then he said um i know more than all the general about isil and then he said i m go to call the general to help me figur out a plan and final he said i m go to fire all the general he doesn t have a plan
p1918

p1923
aVdid you work on that one a long time becaus that had a lot of realli creativ line in it
p1924
aVwell i m go to see if you can defend ani of it
p1925
aVyou both have said you both have said vladimir putin is a better leader than the presid
p1926
aVwell look i can defend i i i can i can make veri clear to the american peopl after travel million of mile as our secretari of state after be the architect of the foreign polici of this administr america is less safe today than it was the day that barack obama becam presid of the unit state it s absolut inargu
p1927
aVwe ve weaken america s place in the world it s been a combin of factor but most it s been a lack of leadership i mean i will give you and i was in washington d c on 9 11 i saw the cloud of smoke rise from the pentagon
p1928
aVi was in virginia where the pentagon s
p1929
aVi know you were we all live through that day as a nation it was heartbreak and i want to give this presid credit for bring osama bin laden to justic
p1930
aVbut the truth is osama bin laden led al qaida our primari threat today is isi and becaus hillari clinton fail to renegoti a status of forc agreement that would have allow some american combat troop to remain in iraq and secur the hard fought gain the american soldier had won by 2009 isi was abl to be liter conjur up out of the desert and it s overrun vast area that the american soldier had won in oper iraqi freedom
p1931
aVmy heart break for the like of lanc cpl scott zubowski he fell in fallujah in 2005 he fought hard through some of the most difficult day in oper iraqi freedom and he paid the ultim sacrific to defend our freedom and secur that nation and that nation was secur in 2009
p1932
aVbut becaus hillari clinton and barack obama fail to provid a status of forc agreement and leav suffici troop in there we are back at war the presid just order more troop on the ground we are back at war in iraq and scott zubowski whose mom would alway come to memori day event in newcastl indiana to see me and i d give her a hug and tell her we re never go to forget her son and we never will scott zubowski and the sacrific the american soldier made were squander in iraq becaus this administr creat a vacuum in which isi was abl to grow
p1933
aVand a refer to the iranian deal the iranian deal that hillari clinton initi 150 billion to the radic mullah in iran
p1934
aVstop a nuclear weapon program without fire a shot

aVeven the isra militari say it stop
p1940
aVguarante that iran will someday becom a nuclear power becaus there s no limit onc the period of time of the treati come off
p1941
aVwell i think it s i think it s a great question elain but it realli doe begin with us reform our immigr system and put the interest particular the safeti and secur of the american peopl first
p1942
aVi mean donald trump has call for extrem vet for peopl come into this countri so that we don t bring peopl into the unit state who are hostil to our bill of right freedom who are hostil to the american way life
p1943
aVbut also donald trump and i are commit to suspend the syrian refuge program and program and immigr from area of the world that have been compromis by terror hillari clinton and tim kain want to increas the syrian refuge program by 500
p1944
aVelain i want to
p1945
aVyeah and so but first you know let s make sure we re put the safeti and secur of the american peopl first instead of hillari clinton expand the syrian refuge program
p1946
aVor instead of you violat the constitut by block peopl base on their nation origin rather than whether they re danger
p1947
aVthat s not that s absolut fals
p1948
aVthat s what the seventh circuit decid just here s the differ elain
p1949
aVthe seventh circuit
p1950
aVwe have differ view on on refuge issu and on immigr hillari and i want to do enforc base on are peopl danger these guy say all mexican are bad
p1951
aVthat s absolut fals
p1952
aVand with respect to refuge we want to keep peopl out if they re danger donald trump said keep them out if they re muslim mike penc
p1953
aVabsolut
p1954
aVput a program in place to keep them out if they re from syria and yesterday an appel court with three republican judg struck down the penc plan
p1955
aVbut in the midst elain thank you thank you thank you senat i ll
p1956
aVright right
p1957
aVand said it was discriminatori
p1958
aVand those judg those judg said
p1959
aVwe should focus upon danger not upon discrimin
p1960
aVelain to your point those judg said it was becaus there wasn t ani evid yet that that isi had infiltr the unit state well germani just arrest three syrian refuge that were connect to isi
p1961
ag657
aVbut they told you there s a right way and a wrong way to do it
p1962
aVbut look if you re go to be critic of me on that that s fair game i will tell you after two syrian refuge were involv in the attack in pari that is call pari 9 11 as governor of the state of indiana i have no higher prioriti than the safeti and secur of the peopl of my state
p1963
aVbut governor penc
p1964
aVthese guy have prais vladimir putin as a great leader how can that
p1965
aVso you bet i suspend that program
p1966
aVbut governor penc i just
p1967
aVand i stand by that decis and if i m vice presid of the unit state or donald trump is presid we re go to put the safeti and secur of the american peopl first
p1968
aVsure can we just be clear hillari and i will do immigr enforc and we ll vet refuge base on whether they re danger or not we won t do it base on discrimin against you from the countri you come from or the religion that you practic
p1969
aVbut the problem with that
p1970
aVthat is complet antithet to the jeffersonian valu of
p1971
aVelain the director of the fbi our homeland secur said we can t know for certain who these peopl are come from syria
p1972
aVyes we can and when we don t let them know we don t let them in
p1973
aVso the fbi
p1974
aVwhen we don t know who they are we don t let them in
p1975
aVthe fbi and homeland secur said we can t know for certain you ve got to err on the side of the safeti and secur of the american peopl senat i understand the
p1976
aVby trash all syrian or trash all muslim
p1977
aVthe u n want us to expand the syrian refuge program
p1978
aVwe re go to put the safeti and secur of the american peopl first
p1979
aVyes
p1980
aVintellig surg is two third elain it s two thing it s first dramat expand our intellig capac by hire great profession but also we ve got some of the best intel and cyber employe in the world right here in the unit state work for mani of our privat sector compani
p1981
aVso it involv increas our own workforc but strike great partnership with some of our cyber and intel expert in the privat sector so that we can consist with constitut principl gather more intellig
p1982
aVwell senat i must have hit a
p1983
aVbut the second piec of this is realli realli import it also mean creat stronger allianc becaus you gather intellig and then you share your intellig back and forth with alli and that s how you find out who may be tri to recruit who may be tri to come to one countri or the next allianc are critic
p1984
aVthat s whi donald trump s claim that he want to that nato is obsolet and that we need to get rid of nato is so danger
p1985
aVthat s not his plan kain well he said nato is obsolet and look if you put asid push asid your allianc who you re go to share intellig with hillari clinton is the secretari of state who know how to build allianc she built the sanction regim around the word that stop the iranian nuclear weapon program and that s what an intellig surg mean better skill and capac but also better allianc
p1986
aVcan i speak about the cybersecur surg at all
p1987
aVfirst donald trump just spoke about this issu this week we have got to bring togeth the best resourc of this countri to understand that cyber warfar is the new warfar of the asymmetr enemi that we face in this countri and i look forward if i m privileg to be in this role of work with you in the senat to make sure that we resourc that effort
p1988
aVwe will work togeth in whatev role we inhabit
p1989
aVwe have an intellig sir but i will also tell you that it s import in this moment to rememb that hillari clinton had a privat server in her home that had classifi inform on it
p1990
aVabout drone strike e mail from the presid of the unit state of america were on there
p1991
aVher privat server was subject to be hack by foreign
p1992
aVwe could put cybersecur first if we just make sure the next secretari of state doesn t have a privat server
p1993
ag657
aVand all investig conclud that not one reason prosecutor would take ani addit step you don t get to decid the right and wrong of this we have a justic system that doe that and a republican fbi director did an investig and conclud that
p1994
aVif your son or my son handl classifi inform the way hillari clinton did
p1995
aVbecaus at a time of great challeng in the life of this nation where we ve weaken america s place in the world stifl america s economi the campaign of hillari clinton and tim kain has been an avalanch of insult
p1996
aVthey d be court martial
p1997
aVthat is absolut fals and you know that
p1998
aVabsolut true
p1999
aVand you know that governor
p2000
aVit s absolut true
p2001
aVbecaus the fbi did an investig
p2002
aVand they conclud that there was no reason prosecutor who would take it further sorri
p2003
aVlook to get to your question about trustworthi donald trump has built a busi through hard time and through good time he s brought an extraordinari busi acumen he s employ ten of thousand of peopl in this countri
p2004
aVsyria
p2005
aVthe unit state of america need to begin to exercis strong leadership to protect the vulner citizen and over 100 000 children in aleppo hillari clinton s top prioriti when she becam secretari of state was the russian reset the russian reset after the russian reset the russian invad ukrain and took over crimea
p2006
aVand the small and bulli leader of russia is now dictat term to the unit state to the point where all the unit state of america the greatest nation on earth just withdraw from talk about a ceas fire while vladimir putin put a missil defens system in syria while he marshal the forc and begin look we have got to begin to lean into this with strong broad shoulder american leadership
p2007
aVit begin by rebuild our militari and the russian and the chines have been make enorm invest in the militari we have the smallest navi sinc 1916 we have the lowest number of troop sinc the end of the second world war we ve got to work with congress and donald trump will to rebuild our militari and project american strength in the world
p2008
aVbut about aleppo and about syria i truli do believ that what america ought to do right now is immedi establish safe zone so that famili and vulner famili with children can move out of those area work with our arab partner real time right now to make that happen
p2009
aVand second i just have to tell you that the provoc by russia need to be met with american strength and if russia choos to be involv and continu i should say to be involv in this barbar attack on civilian in aleppo the unit state of america should be prepar to use militari forc to strike militari target of the assad regim to prevent them from this humanitarian crisi that is take place in aleppo
p2010
aVthere s a broad rang of other thing that we ought to do as well we ought to deploy a missil defens shield to the czech republ and poland which hillari clinton and barack obama pull back on out of not want to offend the russian back in 2009
p2011
aVand paid few tax and lost a billion a year
p2012
aVwe ve just got to have american strength on the world stage when donald trump becom presid of the unit state the russian and other countri in the world will know they re deal with a strong american presid
p2013
aVhillari and i also agre that the establish of humanitarian zone in northern syria with the provis of intern human aid consist with the u n secur council resolut that was pass in februari 2014 would be a veri veri good idea
p2014
aVand hillari also has the abil to stand up to russia in a way that this ticket doe not donald trump again and again has prais vladimir putin and it s clear that he has busi deal with russian oligarch who are veri connect to putin
p2015
aVthe trump campaign manag team had to be fire a month or so ago becaus of those shadowi connect with pro putin forc governor penc made the odd claim he said inargu vladimir putin is a better leader than presid obama vladimir putin has run his economi into the ground he persecut lgbt folk and journalist if you don t know the differ between dictatorship and leadership then you got to go back to a fifth grade civic class
p2016
aVi ll tell you what offend me
p2017
aVwell that offend me
p2018
aVgovernor penc just said governor penc just said that donald trump will rebuild the militari no he won t donald trump is avoid pay tax the new york time stori and we need to get this but the new york time suggest that he probabl didn t pay tax for about 18 year start in 1995 those year includ the year of 9 11
p2019
aVso get this on 9 11 hillari clinton and donald trump s hometown was attack by the worst terrorist attack in the histori of the unit state young men and women young men and women sign up to serv in the militari to fight terror hillari clinton went to washington to get fund to rebuild her citi and protect first respond but donald trump was fight a veri differ fight it was a fight to avoid pay tax so that he wouldn t support the fight against terror
p2020
ag657
aVhe wouldn t support troop he wouldn t he wouldn t support this is import elain when a guy run for presid will not support the troop not support veteran not support teacher that s realli import
p2021
aVand i said about aleppo we do agre the notion is we have to creat a humanitarian zone in northern syria it s veri import
p2022
aVwell first and foremost donald trump support our troop donald trump support our veteran
p2023
aVhe won t pay tax
p2024
aVdonald trump has paid all the tax that he s do you not take deduct how doe that work
p2025
aVhonest senat honest senat
p2026
aVit is about our troop it is about our troop
p2027
aVi understand whi you want to chang i understand whi you want to chang the subject
p2028
aVhow can you support the troop if you won t pay tax
p2029
aVi understand whi you want to chang the subject and let me be veri clear on this russian thing the larger question here
p2030
aVdo you think donald trump is smart to not pay tax
p2031
aVwhat we re deal with is the you know there s an old proverb that say the russian bear never die it just hibern and the truth of the matter is the weak and feckless foreign polici of hillari clinton and barack obama has awaken an aggress in russia that first appear a few year ago with their move in georgia now their move into crimea now their move into the wider middl east
p2032
aVand all the while all we do is fold our arm and say we re not have talk anymor to answer your question we just need american strength we need to we need to marshal the resourc of our alli in the region and in the immedi we need to act and act now to get peopl out of harm s way
p2033
aVthe the safe zone would have to be as the senat said there s alreadi a framework for this that s been recogn by the intern communiti the unit state of america need to be prepar to work with our alli in the region to creat a rout for safe passag and then to protect peopl in those area includ with a no fli zone
p2034
aVbut look this is veri tough stuff i serv on the foreign affair committe for a decad i travel in and out of that region for 10 year i saw what the american soldier won in oper iraqi freedom and to see the weak and feckless leadership that hillari clinton was the architect of and the foreign polici of the obama administr
p2035
aVbut there s a there s a reason whi peopl question the trustworthi of hillari clinton and that s becaus they re pay attent i mean the realiti is when she was secretari of state senat come on she had a clinton foundat accept contribut from foreign govern
p2036
aVwell let me let me come back
p2037
aVis deepli troubl to me that will all chang the day donald trump becom presid of the unit state

p2042
aVthat it s a good thing not a bad thing that it s a good thing not a bad thing that we re down from 175 000 troop deploy oversea to 15 000
p2043
aVbut let me tell you what will realli make the middl east danger donald trump s idea that more nation should get nuclear weapon saudi arabia japan south korea ronald reagan said someth realli interest about nuclear prolifer back in the 1980s he said the problem with nuclear prolifer is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastroph event and i think that s who governor penc s run mate is exact who governor reagan warn us about
p2044
aVand come on senat senat that was even beneath you and hillari clinton and that that s pretti low
p2045
aVbut do you do you think do you think we should have more nuclear weapon in the world will make us safer
p2046
aVyou are donald trump s apprentic let me talk about this
p2047
aVsenat the
p2048
aVthat s what donald trump think
p2049
aVronald reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought becaus it can never be won and the unit state of america need to make invest in modern our nuclear forc for both deterr
p2050
aVbut can you defend donald trump s claim that more nation should get nuclear weapon
p2051
aVand assur to our alli but let me go back to this iran thing i mean he keep say that they prevent that hillari clinton start the deal with the iranian prevent iran from get a nuclear weapon

p2061
aVand then hillari use them to get a deal
p2062
aVwe were bring them to heel but the goal was alway that we would onli lift the sanction if iran perman renounc their nuclear ambit
p2063

p2076
aVdon t put word in my mouth well he never said that senat
p2077
aVhe absolut said it saudi arabia south korea japan

aVmost of the stuffi you ve said he s never said

p2083
aVshe went toe to toe with russia and lodg protest when they went into georgia and we ve done the same thing about ukrain but more than launch protest we ve put punish econom sanction on russia that we need to continu
p2084
aVdonald trump on the other hand didn t know that russia had invad the crimea
p2085
aVoh that s nonsens
p2086
aVhe was on a tv show a coupl month back and he said i ll guarante you this russia s not go into the ukrain and he had to be remind that they had gone into the crimea two year befor
p2087
aVhe knew that
p2088

p2089
aVon the other hand in donald trump you have somebodi who prais vladimir putin all the time america should realli wonder about a presid trump who had a campaign manag with tie to putin pro putin element in the ukrain who had to be fire for that reason they should wonder when donald trump is sit down with vladimir putin is it go to be america s bottom line or is it go to be donald trump s bottom line that he s go to be worri about with all of his busi deal
p2090
aVnow this could be solv if donald trump would be will to releas his tax return as he told the american public that he would do and i know he s laugh at this but everi presid

p2105
aVthis isn t the old day where you can just say stuff and peopl believ it
p2106
aVlook this is the altern univers of washington d c versus realiti hillari clinton said her number one prioriti was a reset with russia that reset result in the invas of ukrain after they d infiltr with what are call littl green men russian soldier that were dress up like ukrainian dissid and then they move all the way into crimea took over the crimean peninsula donald trump knew that happen he basic was say it s not go to happen again the truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggress russia which has had increas it influenc in iran that s now now becaus of this deal is on a pathway in the futur to obtain a nuclear the lead state sponsor of terror in the world in iran now has a closer work relationship with russia becaus of hillari clinton and barack obama s foreign polici and 150 billion and sanction all be lift
p2107
aVand then of cours syria i mean it realli is extraordinari that syria is implod you just ask a veri thought question about the disast in aleppo isi is headquart in raqqa it is isi from raqqa has overrun vast area that at great sacrific the american soldier won in oper iraqi freedom and yet senat kain still sit here loyal soldier i get all that in say that the foreign polici of hillari clinton and barack obama somehow made the world more secur i mean it realli is astonish that on the day

aVon the day that iran releas four american hostag
p2110
aVwe stop iran from get nuclear weapon
p2111
aVthe clinton foundat accept foreign contribut from foreign govern and foreign donor while she was secretari of state

aVand we stop a nuclear weapon program without a shot
p2114
aVstrength plain and simpl
p2115
aVbusi deal
p2116
aVdonald trump that s nonsens donald trump is a strong leader
p2117
aVdonald trump s son say that the trump organ
p2118
aVok now i can weigh in now
p2119
aVwho is go to lead with american strength
p2120
aVwe re go to rebuild our militari and let me let me this whole putin thing look america is stronger than russia our economi is 16 time larger than the russian economi america s polit system is superior to the croni corrupt capitalist system in russia in everi way
p2121
aVwhen donald trump and i observ that as i ve said in syria in iran in ukrain that the small and bulli leader of russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administr that s state pain fact that s not an endors of vladimir putin that s an indict of the weak and feckless leadership
p2122
aVof hillari clinton and barack obama
p2123
aVwell this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it but governor penc said inargu vladimir putin is a better leader than presid obama
p2124
aVthat is absolut inaccur
p2125
aVand and and i just think a guy who prais
p2126
aVhe said he s stronger he s been stronger on the world stage
p2127
aVshe had a privat server
p2128
aVno he said leader and if and i ll just say this governor
p2129
aVyou just said better
p2130
aVif you mistak leadership for dictatorship and you can t tell the differ a countri that s run it economi into the ground
p2131
aVyeah here we go this is the grade school thing again
p2132
aVpersecut journalist
p2133
aVright this is grade school
p2134
aVif you can t tell the differ you shouldn t be command in chief
p2135
aVyeah
p2136
aVand with donald trump donald trump s son say that they have all these busi deal with russia those could be disclos with tax return but they refus to do them american need to worri about whether donald trump will be watch out for america s bottom line or his own bottom line
p2137
aVnow i get to weigh in now let me just say this
p2138
aVvladimir putin vladimir putin is a dictat
p2139
aVvladimir putin is a dictat he s not a leader anybodi who think otherwis doesn t know russian histori and they don t know vladimir putin hillari clinton know exact who this guy is john mccain said i look in his eye and i see kgb and hillari kind of has that same feel
p2140
aVright
p2141
aVso how do deal with him you ve got to we do have to deal with russia in a lot of differ way there are area where we can cooper so it was hillari clinton who work with russia on the new start treati to reduc their nuclear weapon stockpil it was hillari clinton that work with russia to get them engag in a communiti of nation to stop the iranian nuclear weapon without fire a shot
p2142
aVshe s not go around prais vladimir putin as a great guy but she know how to sit down at a tabl and negoti tough deal this is a veri challeng part of the world and we ought to have a command in chief who is prepar and done it rather than somebodi who goe around prais vladimir putin as a great leader
p2143
aVright
p2144
aVwell first we need to we need to make a commit to rebuild our militari includ modern our nuclear forc and we also need we also need an effect american diplomaci that will marshal the resourc of nation in the asian pacif rim to put pressur on north korea on kim jong un to abandon his nuclear ambit it has to remain the polici of the unit state of america the denuclear of the korean peninsula plain and simpl
p2145
aVthat was discov
p2146
aVand when donald trump is presid of the unit state we re we re not go to have the the kind of postur in the world that has russia invad crimea and ukrain that has the chines build new island in the south china sea that has liter the world includ north korea flout american power we re go to we re go to go back to the day of peac through strength
p2147
aVbut i have to tell you that that all this talk about tax return and i get it you know you want to keep bring that up it must have must have
p2148
aVuntil he
p2149
aVdone well in some focus group but here hillari clinton and her husband set up a privat foundat call the clinton foundat while she was secretari of state the clinton foundat accept ten of million of dollar from foreign govern and foreign donor
p2150
aVnow you all need to know out there this is basic stuff foreign donor and certain foreign govern cannot particip in the american polit process they cannot make financi contribut but the clinton figur out a way to creat a foundat where foreign govern and foreign donor could donat million of dollar and then we found thank to the good work of the associ press that more than half her privat meet when she was secretari of state were given to major donor of the clinton foundat when you talk about all these all these baseless rumor about russia and the rest hillari clinton you ask the trustworthi question at the veri begin the reason
p2151
aVthe reason the american peopl don t trust hillari clinton is becaus they are look at the pay to play polit that she oper with the clinton foundat through a privat server
p2152
aVwhile she s secretari of state
p2153
aVand they re say enough is enough
p2154
aVi m go to talk about the foundat and then i ll talk about north korea so on the foundat i am glad to talk about the foundat the clinton foundat is one of the highest rate chariti in the world it provid aid drug to about 11 5 million peopl it help american deal with opioid overdos it get higher rank for it chariti than the american red cross doe the clinton foundat doe an aw lot of good work
p2155
aVhillari clinton as secretari of state took no action to benefit the foundat the state depart did an investig and they conclud that everyth hillari clinton did as secretari of state was complet in the interest of the unit state so the foundat doe good work and hillari clinton as secretari of state act in the interest of the unit state
p2156
aVbut let s compar this now with the trump organ and the trump foundat the trump organ is an octopus like organ with tentacl all over the world whose conflict of interest could onli be known if donald trump would releas his tax return he s refus to do it
p2157
aVhis son have said that the organ has a lot of busi deal in russia and rememb the trump organ is not a non profit it s put money into donald trump s pocket and into the pocket of his children wherea the clinton foundat is a non profit and no clinton famili member draw ani salari
p2158
aVthe trump foundat is non profit
p2159
aVin addit donald trump has a foundat the foundat was just fine for illeg contribut foundat dollar to a polit campaign of a florida attorney general they made an illeg contribut and then they tri to hide it by disguis it to somebodi els and the person they donat to was somebodi whose offic was charg with investig trump univers
p2160
aVthis is the differ between a foundat that doe good work and a secretari of state who act in accord with american interest and somebodi who is conflict and do work around the world and won t share with the american public what he s do and what those conflict are
p2161
aVkeep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public
p2162
aVwell thank you thank you the trump foundat is a privat famili foundat they give virtual everi cent in the trump foundat to charit caus
p2163
aVpolit contribut
p2164
aVless than ten cent on the dollar in the clinton foundat has gone to charit caus
p2165
aVa 20 000 portrait of donald trump penc less than 10 cent on the dollar of the clinton foundat has gone to charit caus
p2166
aVnineti percent
p2167
aVit has been a platform for the clinton to travel the world to have staff but honest senat we would know a lot more about it if hillari clinton would just turn over the 33 000 e mail
p2168
aVthat she refus to turn over in her privat server
p2169
aVand we d have a much better pictur of what the clinton foundat was about
p2170
aVgovernor penc governor penc doesn t think the world s go so well and he you know is go to say it s everybodi s fault
p2171
aVif we look a presid should take action to defend the unit state against immin threat you have to a presid has to do that now exact what action you would have to determin what your intellig was how certain you were of that intellig but you would have to take action
p2172
aVyou ask the question about how do we deal with a north korea i m on the foreign relat committe we just did an extens sanction packag against north korea and interest enough elain the u n follow and did this virtual the same packag often china will use their veto in the secur council to veto a packag like that they re start to get worri about north korea too so they actual support the sanction packag even though mani of the sanction are against chines firm chines financi institut
p2173
aVso we re work togeth with china and we need to china s anoth one of those relationship where it s competit it s also challeng and in time like north korea we have to be abl to cooper hillari understand that veri well she went onc famous to china and stood up at a human right meet and look them in the eye and said women s right are human right they didn t want her to say that but she did
p2174
aVbut she s also work on a lot of diplomat and import diplomat deal with china and that s what it s go to take
p2175
aVthe thing i would worri a littl bit about is that donald trump owe about 650 million to bank includ the bank of china i m not sure he could stand up so tough to the peopl who have loan him money
p2176
aVyeah that s an easi one for me elain it s an easi one i m realli fortun i grew up in a wonder household with great irish cathol parent my mom and dad are sit right here i was educ by jesuit at rockhurst high school in kansa citi my 40th reunion is in 10 day
p2177
aVand i work with jesuit missionari in hondura now near 35 year ago and they were the hero of my life i tri to practic my religion in a veri devout way and follow the teach of my church in my own person life but i don t believ in this nation a first amend nation where we don t rais ani religion over the other and we allow peopl to worship as they pleas that the doctrin of ani one religion should be mandat for everyon
p2178
aVfor me the hardest struggl in my faith life was the cathol church is against the death penalti and so am i but i was governor of a state and the state law said that there was a death penalti for crime if the juri determin them to be heinous and so i had to grappl with that
p2179
aVdo you
p2180
aVwhen i was run for governor i was attack pretti strong becaus of my posit on the death penalti but i look the voter of virginia in the eye and said look this is my religion i m not go to chang my religi practic to get one vote but i know how to take an oath and uphold the law and if you elect me i will uphold the law
p2181
aVand i was elect and i did it was veri veri difficult to allow execut to go forward but in circumst where i didn t feel like there was a case for clemenc i told virginia voter i would uphold the law and i did
p2182
aVthat was a real struggl but i think it is realli realli import that those of us who have deep faith live don t feel that we could just substitut our own view for everybodi els in societi regardless of their view
p2183
aVwell it s a wonder question and my christian faith is at the veri heart of who i am i was also rais in a wonder famili of faith it was a church on sunday morn and grace befor dinner
p2184
aVbut my christian faith becam real for me when i made a person decis for christ when i was a freshman in colleg and i ve tri to live that out howev imperfect everi day of my life sinc and with my wife at my side we ve follow a call into public servic where we ve we ve tri to we ve tri to keep faith with the valu that we cherish
p2185
aVand with regard to when i struggl i appreci and and and i have a great deal of respect for senat kain s sincer faith i truli do
p2186
aVthat s share
p2187
aVbut for me i would tell you that for me the sanctiti of life proceed out of the belief that that ancient principl that where god say befor you were form in the womb i knew you and so for my first time in public life i sought to stand with great compass for the sanctiti of life
p2188
aVthe state of indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand altern in health care counsel for women non abort altern i m also veri pleas at the fact we re well on our way in indiana to becom the most pro adopt state in america i think if you re go to be pro life you should you should be pro adopt
p2189
aVlet me tell you this when hillari clinton becam secretari of state governor penc did you know that osama bin laden was aliv
p2190
aVbut what i can t understand is with hillari clinton and now senat kain at her side is to support a practic like partial birth abort i mean to hold to the view and i know senat kain you hold pro life view person but the veri idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me
p2191
aVand i cannot i can t conscienc about about a parti that support that or that i know you ve histor oppos taxpay fund of abort but hillari clinton want to want to repeal the longstand provis in the law where we said we wouldn t use taxpay dollar to fund abort
p2192
aVso for me my faith inform my life i tri and spend a littl time on my knee everi day but it all for me begin with cherish the digniti the worth the valu of everi human life
p2193
aVelain this is a fundament question a fundament question hillari and i are both peopl out of religi background from methodist church experi which was realli format for her as a public servant
p2194
aVbut we realli feel like you should live fulli and with enthusiasm the command of your faith but it is not the role of the public servant to mandat that for everybodi els
p2195
aVso let s talk about abort and choic let s talk about them we support roe v wade we support the constitut right of american women to consult their own conscienc their own support partner their own minist but then make their own decis about pregnanc that s someth we trust american women to do that
p2196
aVand we don t think that women should be punish as donald trump said they should for make the decis to have an abort
p2197
aVgovernor penc want to repeal roe v wade he said he want to put it on the ash heap of histori and we have some young peopl in the audienc who weren t even born when roe was decid this is pretti import befor roe v wade state could pass crimin law to do just that to punish women if they made the choic to termin a pregnanc
p2198
aVi think you should live your moral valu but the last thing the veri last thing that govern should do is have law that would punish women who make reproduct choic and that is the fundament differ between a clinton kain ticket and a trump penc ticket that want to punish women who make that choic
p2199
aVno it s realli not donald trump and i would never support legisl that punish women who made the heartbreak choic to end a pregnanc
p2200
aVyes
p2201
aVthen whi did donald trump say that
p2202
aVwe just never would
p2203
aVwhi did he say that
p2204
aVwell look it s look he s not a polish politician like you and hillari clinton and so
p2205
aVwell i would admit that s not a polish
p2206
aVyou know thing don t alway come out exact the way he mean them
p2207
aVwell can i say
p2208
aVbut i m tell you what the polici of our administr would be
p2209
aVgreat line from the great line from the gospel of matthew from the full of the heart the mouth speak
p2210
aVyeah
p2211

aVelimin the iranian nuclear weapon program
p2233
aVthat s a realli import one that may be the 64 000 question becaus it has been a divis campaign and again hillari is run a campaign about stronger togeth and donald trump and this is this is not direct at this man except to the extent that he can t defend donald trump donald trump has run a campaign that s been about one insult after the next
p2234
aVbut we do have to bring the countri togeth so here s what we ll do hillari clinton was first ladi then senat for eight year and secretari of state and i serv in the senat and i m realli amaz elain as i talk to republican senat how well they regard and respect hillari clinton

p2237
aVshe has a track record of work across the aisl to make thing happen and you know elain i have the same track record i was a governor of virginia with two republican hous and in the senat i have good work relationship across the aisl
p2238
aVbecaus i think it s fine to be a democrat or republican or independ but after elect day the goal is work togeth and hillari clinton has a track record of accomplish across the aisl that will enabl her to do just that when we work with the new congress in januari
p2239
aVwell thank you elain and thank for a great discuss

aVtonight thank you senat

aVabsolut without fire a shot and instead of 175 000 american troop deploy oversea we now have 15 000
p2243
aVthis is a veri challeng time in the life of our nation weaken america s place in the world after the leadership of hillari clinton and barack obama on the world stage has been follow by an economi that is truli struggl stifl by an avalanch of more tax more regul obamacar the war on coal and the kind of trade deal that have put american worker in the back seat i think the best way that we can bring peopl togeth is through chang in washington d c
p2244
aVyou know i serv in washington d c for 12 year in the congress of the unit state and i serv with mani republican and democrat men and women of goodwil the potenti is there to realli chang the direct of this countri but it s go to take leadership to do it
p2245
aVthe american peopl want to see our nation stand tall on the world stage again they want to see us support our militari rebuild our militari command the respect of the world and they want to see the american economi off to the race again they want to see an american comeback
p2246
aVand donald trump s entir career has been about build it s been about it s go through hardship just like a businessperson doe and find a way through smart and ingenu and resili to fight forward and when donald trump becom presid of the unit state we re go to have a stronger america
p2247
aVwhen you hear him say he want to make america great again when we do that i truli do believ the american peopl are go to be stand taller they re go to see that real chang can happen after decad of just talk about it and when that happen the american peopl are go to stand tall stand togeth and we ll have the kind of uniti that s been miss for way too long
p2248
aVright and
p2249
aVthese are veri veri good thing
p2250
aVand iraq has been overrun by isi becaus hillari clinton fail to renegoti
p2251
aVwell if you want to put more american troop in iraq you can propos that
p2252
aVhillari clinton hillari clinton hillari clinton fail to renegoti a status of forc agreement
p2253
aVno that is incorrect that s incorrect
p2254
aVand so we remov we remov all of our
p2255
aVtroop from iraq and isi was abl to be conjur up in that vacuum
p2256
aVbut i d like to correct
p2257
aVand overrun vast area of iraq
p2258
aVgovernor presid bush said we would leav iraq at the end of 2011 and elain iraq didn t want our troop to stay and they wouldn t give us the protect for our troop and guess what if a nation where our troop are serv doe not want us to stay we re not go to stay without their protect
p2259
aVit was a failur of the secretari of state
p2260
aVelain thank you for be here tonight and governor penc welcom it is so great to be back at longwood univers in farmvill virginia
p2261
aVif governor penc want to put more troop back in iraq that s
p2262
aVok
p2263
aVi think the fact that that under this past administr was of which hillari clinton was a part we ve almost doubl the nation debt is atroci i mean i m veri proud of the fact that i come from a state that work the state of indiana has balanc budget we cut tax we ve made record invest in educ and in infrastructur and i still finish my term with 2 billion in the bank
p2264
aVthat s a littl bit differ than when senat kain was governor here in virginia he actual he actual tri to rais tax by about 4 billion he left his state about 2 billion in the hole in the state of indiana we ve cut unemploy in half unemploy doubl when he was governor
p2265
aVbut i think he s a veri fit run mate for hillari clinton becaus in the wake of a season where american famili are struggl in this economi under the weight of higher tax and obamacar and the war on coal and the stifl avalanch of regul come out of this administr hillari clinton and tim kain want more of the same it realli is remark that they actual are advoc a trillion dollar in tax increas which i get that you tri to rais tax here in virginia and were unsuccess
p2266
aVbut a trillion dollar in tax increas more regul more of the same war on coal and more of obamacar that now even former presid bill clinton call obamacar a crazi plan but hillari clinton and tim kain want to build on obamacar they want to expand it into a singl payer program and for all the world hillari clinton just think obamacar is a good start
p2267
aVlook donald trump and i have a plan to get this economi move again just the way that it work in the 1980s just the way it work in the 1960s and that is by lower tax across the board for work famili small busi and famili farm end the war on coal that is hurt job and hurt this economi even here in virginia repeal obamacar lock stock and barrel and repeal all of the execut order that barack obama has sign that are stifl econom growth in this economi
p2268
aVthis is a veri special place sixti five year ago a young courag woman barbara john led a walkout of her high school moton high school she made histori by protest school segreg she believ our nation was stronger togeth and that walkout led to the brown v board of educ decis that move us down the path toward equal
p2269
aVwe can get america move again put on top of that the kind of trade deal that ll put the american worker first and you ve got a prescript for real growth and when you get the economi grow elain that s when you can deal with the nation debt when we get back to 3 5 percent to 4 percent growth with donald trump s plan will do then we re go to have the resourc to meet our nation s need at home and abroad and we re go to have the abil to bring down the nation debt
p2270
aVelain on the economi there s a fundament choic for the american elector do you want a you re hire presid in hillari clinton or do you want a you re fire presid in donald trump i think that s not such a hard choic
p2271
aVhillari and i have a plan that s on the tabl that s a you re hire plan five compon first thing we do is we invest in manufactur infrastructur and research in the clean energi job of tomorrow second thing is we invest in our workforc from pre k educ to great teacher to debt free colleg and tuition free colleg for famili that make less than 125 000 a year
p2272
aVthird we promot fair by rais the minimum wage so you can t work full time and be under the poverti level and by pay women equal pay for equal work
p2273
aVfourth we promot small busi growth just as we ve done in virginia to make it easier to start and grow small busi hillari and i each grew up in small busi famili my dad who ran an iron work and weld shop is here tonight
p2274
aVand fifth we have a tax plan that target tax relief to middl class individu and small busi and ask those at the veri top who ve benefit as we ve come out of recess to pay more
p2275
aVthe trump plan is a differ plan it s a you re fire plan and there s two key element to it first donald trump said wage are too high and both donald trump and mike penc think we ought to elimin the feder minimum wage
p2276
aVmike penc when he was in congress vote against rais the minimum wage abov 5 15 and he has been a one man bulwark against minimum wage increas in indiana
p2277
aVthe second compon of the plan is massiv tax break for the veri top trillion of dollar of tax break for peopl just like donald trump the problem with this elain is that s exact what we did 10 year ago and it put the economi into the deepest recess the deepest recess sinc the 1930s
p2278
aVwell i actual agre with that i agre with everyth she said i began this campaign becaus i was so tire of see such foolish thing happen to our countri this is a great countri this is a great land i ve gotten to know the peopl of the countri over the last year and a half that i ve been do this as a politician i cannot believ i m say that about myself but i guess i have been a politician
p2279
aVit was person e mail not offici
p2280
aVoh 33 000 yeah
p2281
aVnot well we turn over 35 000 so
p2282
aVoh yeah what about the other 15 000
p2283
aVyes that s true i didn t
p2284
aVbecaus you have noth to say
p2285
aVi didn t in the first debat and i m go to tri not to in this debat becaus i d like to get to the question that the peopl have brought here tonight to talk to us about
p2286
aVget off this question
p2287
aVand my whole concept was to make america great again when i watch the deal be made when i watch what s happen with some horribl thing like obamacar where your health insur and health care is go up by number that are astronom 68 percent 59 percent 71 percent when i look at the iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us it s a one side transact where we re give back 150 billion to a terrorist state realli the number one terror state we ve made them a strong countri from realli a veri weak countri just three year ago
p2288
aVok donald i know you re into big divers tonight anyth to avoid talk about your campaign and the way it s explod and the way republican are leav you but let s at least focus
p2289
aVlet s see what happen
p2290
aVon some of the issu that peopl care about tonight let s get to their question
p2291
aVi d like to know anderson whi aren t you bring up the e mail i d like to know whi aren t you bring
p2292
aVno it hasn t it hasn t and it hasn t been finish at all
p2293
aVit s nice to one on three
p2294
aVwhen i look at all of the thing that i see and all of the potenti that our countri has we have such tremend potenti whether it s in busi and trade where we re do so bad last year we had almost 800 billion trade deficit in other word trade with other countri we had an 800 billion deficit it s hard to believ inconceiv
p2295
aVif he want to start he can start no go ahead donald
p2296
aVno i m a gentlemen hillari go ahead
p2297
aVwell i think donald was about to say he s go to solv it by repeal it and get rid of the afford care act and i m go to fix it becaus i agre with you premium have gotten too high copay deduct prescript drug cost and i ve laid out a seri of action that we can take to tri to get those cost down
p2298
aVbut here s what i don t want peopl to forget when we re talk about rein in the cost which has to be the highest prioriti of the next presid when the afford care act pass it wasn t just that 20 million got insur who didn t have it befor but that in and of itself was a good thing i meet these peopl all the time and they tell me what a differ have that insur meant to them and their famili
p2299
aVbut everybodi els the 170 million of us who get health insur through our employe got big benefit number one insur compani can t deni you coverag becaus of a pre exist condit number two no lifetim limit which is a big deal if you have serious health problem
p2300
aVnumber three women can t be charg more than men for our health insur which is the way it use to be befor the afford care act number four if you re under 26 and your parent have a polici you can be on that polici until the age of 26 someth that didn t happen befor
p2301
aVso i want veri much to save what work and is good about the afford care act but we ve got to get cost down we ve got to provid addit help to small busi so that they can afford to provid health insur but if we repeal it as donald has propos and start over again all of those benefit i just mention are lost to everybodi not just peopl who get their health insur on the exchang and then we would have to start all over again
p2302
aVyou say who s make these deal we re go the make great deal we re go to have a strong border we re go to bring back law and order just today policemen was shot two kill and this is happen on a week basi we have to bring back respect to law enforc at the same time we have to take care of peopl on all side we need justic
p2303
aVright now we are at 90 percent health insur coverag that s the highest we ve ever been in our countri
p2304
aVso i want us to get to 100 percent but get cost down and keep qualiti up
p2305
aVit is such a great question and it s mayb the question i get almost more than anyth els outsid of defens obamacar is a disast you know it we all know it it s go up at number that nobodi s ever seen worldwid nobodi s ever seen number like this for health care
p2306
aVit s onli get wors in 17 it implod by itself their method of fix it is to go back and ask congress for more money more and more money we have right now almost 20 trillion in debt
p2307
aVobamacar will never work it s veri bad veri bad health insur far too expens and not onli expens for the person that has it unbeliev expens for our countri it s go to be one of the biggest line item veri short
p2308
aVwe have to repeal it and replac it with someth absolut much less expens and someth that work where your plan can actual be tailor we have to get rid of the line around the state artifici line where we stop insur compani from come in and compet becaus they want and presid obama and whoever was work on it they want to leav those line becaus that give the insur compani essenti monopoli we want competit
p2309
aVyou will have the finest health care plan there is she want to go to a singl payer plan which would be a disast somewhat similar to canada and if you haven t notic the canadian when they need a big oper when someth happen they come into the unit state in mani case becaus their system is so slow it s catastroph in certain way
p2310
aVbut she want to go to singl payer which mean the govern basic rule everyth hillari clinton has been after this for year obamacar was the first step obamacar is a total disast and not onli are your rate go up by number that nobodi s ever believ but your deduct are go up so that unless you get hit by a truck you re never go to be abl to use it
p2311
aVbut i want to do thing that haven t been done includ fix and make our inner citi better for the african american citizen that are so great and for the latino hispan and i look forward to do it it s call make america great again
p2312
aVit is a disastr plan and it has to be repeal and replac
p2313
aVno i mean he clarifi what he meant and it s veri clear look we are in a situat in our countri where if we were to start all over again we might come up with a differ system but we have an employ base system that s where the vast major of peopl get their health care
p2314
aVand the afford care act was meant to tri to fill the gap between peopl who were too poor and couldn t put togeth ani resourc to afford health care name peopl on medicaid obvious medicar which is a singl payer system which take care of our elder and doe a great job do it by the way and then all of the peopl who were employ but peopl who were work but didn t have the money to afford insur and didn t have anybodi an employ or anybodi els to help them
p2315
aVthat was the slot that the obamacar approach was to take and like i say 20 million peopl now have health insur so if we just rip it up and throw it away what donald s not tell you is we just turn it back to the insur compani the way it use to be and that mean the insur compani
p2316
aVget to do pretti much whatev they want includ say look i m sorri you ve got diabet you had cancer your child has asthma
p2317
aVyou may not be abl to have insur becaus you can t afford it so let s fix what s broken about it but let s not throw it away and give it all back to the insur compani and the drug compani that s not go to work
p2318
aVwell i just want just one thing first of all hillari everyth s broken about it everyth number two berni sander said that hillari clinton has veri bad judgment this is a perfect exampl of it tri to save obamacar which is a disast
p2319
aVby the way
p2320
aVwe re go to be abl to you re go to have plan
p2321
aVwell i ll tell you what it mean you re go to have plan that are so good becaus we re go to have so much competit in the insur industri onc we break out onc we break out the line and allow the competit to come
p2322
aVpresid obama anderson excus me presid obama by keep those line the boundari line around each state it was almost gone until just veri toward the end of the passag of obamacar which by the way was a fraud you know that becaus jonathan gruber the architect of obamacar was said he said it was a great lie it was a big lie presid obama said you keep your doctor you keep your plan the whole thing was a fraud and it doesn t work
p2323
aVno i didn t say that at all i don t think you understood what was this was locker room talk i m not proud of it i apolog to my famili i apolog to the american peopl certain i m not proud of it but this is locker room talk
p2324
aVbut when we get rid of those line you will have competit and we will be abl to keep pre exist we ll also be abl to help peopl that can t get don t have money becaus we are go to have peopl protect
p2325
aVand republican feel this way believ it or not and strong this way we re go to block grant into the state we re go to block grant into medicaid into the state
p2326
aVso that we will be abl to take care of peopl without the necessari fund to take care of themselv
p2327
aVwell you re right about islamophobia and that s a shame but one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that becaus there is a problem i mean whether we like it or not and we could be veri polit correct but whether we like it or not there is a problem and we have to be sure that muslim come in and report when they see someth go on when they see hatr go on they have to report it
p2328
aVas an exampl in san bernardino mani peopl saw the bomb all over the apart of the two peopl that kill 14 and wound mani mani peopl horribl wound they ll never be the same muslim have to report the problem when they see them
p2329
aVyou know when we have a world where you have isi chop off head where you have and frank drown peopl in steel cage where you have war and horribl horribl sight all over where you have so mani bad thing happen this is like mediev time we haven t seen anyth like this the carnag all over the world
p2330
aVand you know there s alway a reason for everyth if they don t do that it s a veri difficult situat for our countri becaus you look at orlando and you look at san bernardino and you look at the world trade center go outsid look at pari look at that horribl these are radic islam terrorist
p2331
aVand she won t even mention the word and nor will presid obama he won t use the term radic islam terror now to solv a problem you have to be abl to state what the problem is or at least say the name she won t say the name and presid obama won t say the name but the name is there it s radic islam terror and befor you solv it you have to say the name
p2332
aVwell thank you for ask your question and i ve heard this question from a lot of muslim american across our countri becaus unfortun there s been a lot of veri divis dark thing said about muslim and even someon like captain khan the young man who sacrif himself defend our countri in the unit state armi has been subject to attack by donald
p2333
aVi want to say just a coupl of thing first we ve had muslim in america sinc georg washington and we ve had mani success muslim we just lost a particular well known one with muhammad ali
p2334
aVmy vision of america is an america where everyon has a place if you re will to work hard you do your part you contribut to the communiti that s what america is that s what we want america to be for our children and our grandchildren
p2335
aVit s also veri short sight and even danger to be engag in the kind of demagog rhetor that donald has about muslim we need american muslim to be part of our eye and ear on our front line i ve work with a lot of differ muslim group around america i ve met with a lot of them and i ve heard how import it is for them to feel that they are want and includ and part of our countri part of our homeland secur and that s what i want to see
p2336
aVit s also import i intend to defeat isi to do so in a coalit with major muslim nation right now a lot of those nation are hear what donald say and wonder whi should we cooper with the american and this is a gift to isi and the terrorist violent jihadist terrorist
p2337
aVwe are not at war with islam and it is a mistak and it play into the hand of the terrorist to act as though we are so i want a countri where citizen like you and your famili are just as welcom as anyon els
p2338
aVand they look and they see can you imagin the peopl that are frank do so well against us with isi and they look at our countri and they see what s go on
p2339
aVfirst of all captain khan is an american hero and if i were presid at that time he would be aliv today becaus unlik her who vote for the war without know what she was do i would not have had our peopl in iraq iraq was disast so he would have been aliv today
p2340
aVthe muslim ban is someth that in some form has morph into a extrem vet from certain area of the world hillari clinton want to allow hundr of thousand excus me excus me
p2341
aVwhi don t you interrupt her you interrupt me all the time
p2342
aVwhi don t you interrupt her
p2343
aVit s call extrem vet we are go to area like syria where they re come in by the ten of thousand becaus of barack obama and hillari clinton want to allow a 550 percent increas over obama peopl are come into our countri like we have no idea who they are where they are from what their feel about our countri is and she want 550 percent more this is go to be the great trojan hors of all time
p2344
aVwe have enough problem in this countri i believ in build safe zone i believ in have other peopl pay for them as an exampl the gulf state who are not carri their weight but they have noth but money and take care of peopl but i don t want to have with all the problem this countri has and all of the problem that you see go on hundr of thousand of peopl come in from syria when we know noth about them we know noth about their valu and we know noth about their love for our countri
p2345
aVyes i m veri embarrass by it i hate it but it s locker room talk and it s one of those thing i will knock the hell out of isi we re go to defeat isi isi happen a number of year ago in a vacuum that was left becaus of bad judgment and i will tell you i will take care of isi
p2346
aVwell first of all i will not let anyon into our countri that i think pose a risk to us but there are a lot of refuge women and children think of that pictur we all saw of that 4 year old boy with the blood on his forehead becaus he d been bomb by the russian and syrian air forc
p2347
aVthere are children suffer in this catastroph war larg i believ becaus of russian aggress and we need to do our part we by no mean are carri anywher near the load that europ and other are but we will have vet that is as tough as it need to be from our profession our intellig expert and other
p2348
aVbut it is import for us as a polici you know not to say as donald has said we re go to ban peopl base on a religion how do you do that we are a countri found on religi freedom and liberti how do we do what he has advoc without caus great distress within our own counti are we go to have religi test when peopl fli into our countri and how do we expect to be abl to implement those
p2349
aVso i thought that what he said was extrem unwis and even danger and inde you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist site and what donald trump say about muslim is use to recruit fighter becaus they want to creat a war between us
p2350
aVand the final thing i would say this is the 10th or 12th time that he s deni be for the war in iraq we have it on tape the entir press corp has look at it it s been debunk but it never stop him from say whatev he want to say
p2351

p2360
aVand i will tell you veri strong when berni sander said she had bad judgment she has realli bad judgment becaus we are let peopl into this countri that are go to caus problem and crime like you ve never seen we re also let drug pour through our southern border at a record clip at a record clip and it shouldn t be allow to happen
p2361
aVice just endors me they ve never endors a presidenti candid the border patrol agent 16 500 just recent endors me and they endors me becaus i understand the border she doesn t she want amnesti for everybodi come right in come right over it s a horribl thing she s do she s got bad judgment and honest so bad that she should never be presid of the unit state that i can tell you
p2362
aVand we should get on to much more import thing and much bigger thing
p2363
aVwell right as i recal that was someth i said about abraham lincoln after have seen the wonder steven spielberg movi call lincoln it was a master class watch presid lincoln get the congress to approv the 13th amend it was principl and it was strateg
p2364
aVand i was make the point that it is hard sometim to get the congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep work at it and yes presid lincoln was tri to convinc some peopl he use some argument convinc other peopl he use other argument that was a great i thought a great display of presidenti leadership
p2365
aVbut you know let s talk about what s realli go on here martha becaus our intellig communiti just came out and said in the last few day that the kremlin mean putin and the russian govern are direct the attack the hack on american account to influenc our elect and wikileak is part of that as are other site where the russian hack inform we don t even know if it s accur inform and then they put it out
p2366
aVwe have never in the histori of our countri been in a situat where an adversari a foreign power is work so hard to influenc the outcom of the elect and believ me they re not do it to get me elect they re do it to tri to influenc the elect for donald trump
p2367
aVnow mayb becaus he has prais putin mayb becaus he say he agre with a lot of what putin want to do mayb becaus he want to do busi in moscow i don t know the reason but we deserv answer and we should demand that donald releas all of his tax return so that peopl can see what are the entangl and the financi relationship that he has
p2368
aVwith the russian and other foreign power
p2369
aVwell i think i should respond becaus so ridicul look now she s blame she got caught in a total lie her paper went out to all her friend at the bank goldman sach and everybodi els and she said thing wikileak that just came out and she lie now she s blame the lie on the late great abraham lincoln that s one that i haven t
p2370
aVok honest abe honest abe never lie that s the good thing that s the big differ between abraham lincoln and you that s a big big differ we re talk about some differ
p2371
aVbut as far as other element of what she was say i don t know putin i think it would be great if we got along with russia becaus we could fight isi togeth as an exampl but i don t know putin
p2372
aVbut i notic anytim anyth wrong happen they like to say the russian are she doesn t know if it s the russian do the hack mayb there is no hack but they alway blame russia and the reason they blame russia becaus they think they re tri to tarnish me with russia i know noth about russia i know i know about russia but i know noth about the inner work of russia i don t deal there i have no busi there i have no loan from russia
p2373
aVi have a veri veri great balanc sheet so great that when i did the old post offic on pennsylvania avenu the unit state govern becaus of my balanc sheet which they actual know veri well chose me to do the old post offic between the white hous and congress chose me to do the old post offic one of the primari area thing in fact perhap the primari thing was balanc sheet but i have no loan with russia you could go to the unit state govern and they would probabl tell you that becaus they know my sheet veri well in order to get that develop i had to have
p2374
aVnow the tax are a veri simpl thing as soon as i have first of all i pay hundr of million of dollar in tax mani of her friend took bigger deduct warren buffett took a massiv deduct soro who s a friend of her took a massiv deduct mani of the peopl that are give her all this money that she can do mani more commerci than me gave her took massiv deduct
p2375
aVi pay hundr of million of dollar in tax but but as soon as my routin audit is finish i ll releas my return i ll be veri proud to they re actual quit great
p2376
aVi have great respect for women nobodi has more respect for women than i do
p2377
aVwell one thing i d do is get rid of carri interest one of the greatest provis for peopl like me to be honest with you i give up a lot when i run becaus i knock out the tax code and she could have done this year ago by the way she s a unit state she was a unit state senat
p2378
aVshe complain that donald trump took advantag of the tax code well whi didn t she chang it whi didn t you chang it when you were a senat the reason you didn t is that all your friend take the same advantag that i do and i do you have provis in the tax code that frank we could chang but you wouldn t chang it becaus all of these peopl gave you the money so you can take negat ad on donald trump
p2379
aVbut and i say that about a lot of thing you know i ve heard hillari complain about so mani differ thing over the year i wish you would have done this but she s been there for 30 year she s been do this stuff she never chang and she never will chang she never will chang
p2380
aVwe re get rid of carri interest provis i m lower tax actual becaus i think it s so import for corpor becaus we have corpor leav massiv corpor and littl one littl one can t form we re get rid of regul which goe hand in hand with the lower of the tax
p2381
aVbut we re bring the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent we re cut tax for the middl class and i will tell you we are cut them big leagu for the middl class
p2382
aVand i will tell you hillari clinton is rais your tax folk you can look at me she s rais your tax realli high and what that s go to do is a disast for the countri but she is rais your tax and i m lower your tax that in itself is a big differ we are go to be thrive again we have no growth in this countri there s no growth if china has a gdp of 7 percent it s like a nation catastroph we re down at 1 percent and that s like no growth and we re go lower in my opinion and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our tax are so high just about the highest in the world and i m bring them down to one of the lower in the world and i think it s so import one of the most import thing we can do but she is rais everybodi s tax massiv
p2383
aVwell everyth you ve heard just now from donald is not true i m sorri i have to keep say this but he live in an altern realiti and it is sort of amus to hear somebodi who hasn t paid feder incom tax in mayb 20 year talk about what he s go to do
p2384
aVbut i ll tell you what he s go to do his plan will give the wealthi and corpor the biggest tax cut they ve ever had more than the bush tax cut by at least a factor of two donald alway take care of donald and peopl like donald and this would be a massiv gift and inde the way that he talk about his tax cut would end up rais tax on middl class famili million of middl class famili
p2385
aVnow here s what i want to do i have said nobodi who make less than 250 000 a year and that s the vast major of american as you know will have their tax rais becaus i think we ve got to go where the money is and the money is with peopl who have taken advantag of everi singl break in the tax code
p2386
aVand yes when i was a senat i did vote to close corpor loophol i vote to close i think one of the loophol he took advantag of when he claim a billion dollar loss that enabl him to avoid pay tax
p2387
aVi want to have a tax on peopl who are make a million dollar it s call the buffett rule yes warren buffett is the one who s gone out and said somebodi like him should not be pay a lower tax rate than his secretari i want to have a surcharg on incom abov 5 million
p2388
aVwe have to make up for lost time becaus i want to invest in you i want to invest in hard work famili and i think it s been unfortun but it s happen that sinc the great recess the gain have all gone to the top and we need to revers that
p2389
aVpeopl like donald who paid zero in tax zero for our vet zero for our militari zero for health and educ that is wrong
p2390
aVand we re go to make sure that nobodi no corpor and no individu can get away without pay his fair share to support our countri
p2391
aVof cours i do of cours i do and so do all of her donor or most of her donor i know mani of her donor her donor took massiv tax write off
p2392
aVa lot of my excus me anderson a lot of my write off was depreci and other thing that hillari as a senat allow and she ll alway allow it becaus the peopl that give her all this money they want it that s whi
p2393
aVi ve said thing that frank you hear these thing i said and i was embarrass by it but i have tremend respect for women
p2394
aVsee i understand the tax code better than anybodi that s ever run for presid hillari clinton and it s extrem complex hillari clinton has friend that want all of these provis includ they want the carri interest provis which is veri import to wall street peopl but they realli want the carri interest provis which i believ hillari s leav veri interest whi she s leav carri interest
p2395
aVbut i will tell you that number one i pay tremend number of tax i absolut use it and so did warren buffett and so did georg soro and so did mani of the other peopl that hillari is get money from now i won t mention their name becaus they re rich but they re not famous so we won t make them famous
p2396
aVno but i pay tax and i pay feder tax too but i have a write off a lot of it s depreci which is a wonder charg i love depreci you know she s given it to us
p2397
aVhey if she had a problem for 30 year she s been do this anderson i say it all the time she talk about health care whi didn t she do someth about it she talk about tax whi didn t she do someth about it she doesn t do anyth about anyth other than talk with her it s all talk and no action
p2398
aVand again berni sander it s realli bad judgment she has made bad judgment not onli on tax she s made bad judgment on libya on syria on iraq i mean her and obama whether you like it or not the way they got out of iraq the vacuum they ve left that s whi isi form in the first place they start from that littl area and now they re in 32 differ nation hillari congratul great job
p2399
aVwell here we go again i ve been in favor of get rid of carri interest for year start when i was a senat from new york but that s not the point here
p2400
aVwhi didn t you do it whi didn t you do it
p2401
aVbecaus i was a senat with a republican presid
p2402
aVoh realli
p2403
aVi will be the presid and we will get it done that s exact right
p2404
aVyou could have done it if you were an effect if you were an effect senat you could have done it if you were an effect senat you could have done it but you were not an effect senat
p2405
aVyou know under our constitut presid have someth call veto power look he has now said repeat 30 year this and 30 year that so let me talk about my 30 year in public servic i m veri glad to do so
p2406
aVeight million kid everi year have health insur becaus when i was first ladi i work with democrat and republican to creat the children s health insur program hundr of thousand of kid now have a chanc to be adopt becaus i work to chang our adopt and foster care system after 9 11 i went to work with republican mayor governor and presid to rebuild new york and to get health care for our first respond who were suffer becaus they had run toward danger and gotten sicken by it hundr of thousand of nation guard and reserv member have health care becaus of work that i did and children have safer medicin becaus i was abl to pass a law that requir the dose to be more care done
p2407
aVwhen i was secretari of state i went around the world advoc for our countri but also advoc for women s right to make sure that women had a decent chanc to have a better life and negoti a treati with russia to lower nuclear weapon four hundr piec of legisl have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when i was a senat for eight year
p2408
aVi work veri hard and was veri proud to be re elect in new york by an even bigger margin than i had been elect the first time and as presid i will take that work that bipartisan work that find common ground becaus you have to be abl to get along with peopl to get thing done in washington
p2409
aVand women have respect for me and i will tell you no i have not and i will tell you that i m go to make our countri safe we re go to have border in our countri which we don t have now peopl are pour into our countri and they re come in from the middl east and other place
p2410
aVi ve proven that i can and for 30 year i ve produc result for peopl
p2411
aVshe said a lot of thing that were fals i mean i think we should be allow to mayb
p2412
aVexcus me becaus she has been a disast as a senat a disast
p2413
aVwe re go to make america safe again we re go to make america great again but we re go to make america safe again and we re go to make america wealthi again becaus if you don t do that it just it sound harsh to say but we have to build up the wealth of our nation
p2414
aVwell the situat in syria is catastroph and everi day that goe by we see the result of the regim by assad in partnership with the iranian on the ground the russian in the air bombard place in particular aleppo where there are hundr of thousand of peopl probabl about 250 000 still left and there is a determin effort by the russian air forc to destroy aleppo in order to elimin the last of the syrian rebel who are realli hold out against the assad regim
p2415
aVrussia hasn t paid ani attent to isi they re interest in keep assad in power so i when i was secretari of state advoc and i advoc today a no fli zone and safe zone we need some leverag with the russian becaus they are not go to come to the negoti tabl for a diplomat resolut unless there is some leverag over them and we have to work more close with our partner and alli on the ground
p2416
aVbut i want to emphas that what is at stake here is the ambit and the aggress of russia russia has decid that it s all in in syria and they ve also decid who they want to see becom presid of the unit state too and it s not me i ve stood up to russia i ve taken on putin and other and i would do that as presid
p2417
aVi think wherev we can cooper with russia that s fine and i did as secretari of state that s how we got a treati reduc nuclear weapon it s how we got the sanction on iran that put a lid on the iranian nuclear program without fire a singl shot so i would go to the negoti tabl with more leverag than we have now but i do support the effort to investig for crime war crime commit by the syrian and the russian and tri to hold them account
p2418
aVfirst of all she was there as secretari of state with the so call line in the sand which
p2419
aVno i wasn t i was gone i hate to interrupt you but at some point
p2420
aVok but you were in contact excus me you were
p2421
aVat some point we need to do some fact check here
p2422
aVyou were in total contact with the white hous and perhap sad obama probabl still listen to you i don t think he would be listen to you veri much anymor
p2423
aVobama draw the line in the sand it was laugh at all over the world what happen
p2424
aVnow with that be said she talk tough against russia but our nuclear program has fallen way behind and they ve gone wild with their nuclear program not good our govern shouldn t have allow that to happen russia is new in term of nuclear we are old we re tire we re exhaust in term of nuclear a veri bad thing
p2425
aVnow she talk tough she talk realli tough against putin and against assad she talk in favor of the rebel she doesn t even know who the rebel are you know everi time we take rebel whether it s in iraq or anywher els we re arm peopl and you know what happen they end up be wors than the peopl
p2426
aVlook at what she did in libya with gadhafi gadhafi s out it s a mess and by the way isi has a good chunk of their oil i m sure you probabl have heard that it was a disast becaus the fact is almost everyth she s done in foreign polici has been a mistak and it s been a disast
p2427
aVbut if you look at russia just take a look at russia and look at what they did this week where i agre she wasn t there but possibl she s consult we sign a peac treati everyon s all excit well what russia did with assad and by the way with iran who you made veri power with the dumbest deal perhap i ve ever seen in the histori of deal make the iran deal with the 150 billion with the 1 7 billion in cash which is enough to fill up this room
p2428
aVbut look at that deal iran now and russia are now against us so she want to fight she want to fight for rebel there s onli one problem you don t even know who the rebel are so what s the purpos
p2429
aVand one thing i have to say
p2430
aVi don t like assad at all but assad is kill isi russia is kill isi and iran is kill isi and those three have now line up becaus of our weak foreign polici
p2431
aVright now other nation are take our job and they re take our wealth
p2432
aVok he and i haven t spoken and i disagre i disagre
p2433
aVi think you have to knock out isi right now syria is fight isi we have peopl that want to fight both at the same time but syria is no longer syria syria is russia and it s iran who she made strong and kerri and obama made into a veri power nation and a veri rich nation veri veri quick veri veri quick
p2434
aVi believ we have to get isi we have to worri about isi befor we can get too much more involv she had a chanc to do someth with syria they had a chanc and that was the line and she didn t
p2435
aVi think aleppo is a disast humanitarian wise
p2436
aVi think that it basic has fallen ok it basic has fallen let me tell you someth you take a look at mosul the biggest problem i have with the stupid of our foreign polici we have mosul they think a lot of the isi leader are in mosul so we have announc come out of washington and come out of iraq we will be attack mosul in three week or four week
p2437
aVwell all of these bad leader from isi are leav mosul whi can t they do it quiet whi can t they do the attack make it a sneak attack and after the attack is made inform the american public that we ve knock out the leader we ve had a tremend success peopl leav whi do they have to say we re go to be attack mosul within the next four to six week which is what they re say how stupid is our countri
p2438
aVi can t think of ani i can t think of ani and i m pretti good at it
p2439
aVand we have general flynn and we have look i have 200 general and admir who endors me i have 21 congression medal of honor recipi who endors me we talk about it all the time they understand whi can t they do someth secret where they go in and they knock out the leadership how whi would these peopl stay there i ve been read now
p2440
aVfor week i ve been read now for week about mosul that it s the harbor of where you know between raqqa and mosul this is where they think the isi leader are whi would they be say they re not stay there anymor they re gone becaus everybodi s talk about how iraq which is us with our leadership goe in to fight mosul
p2441
aVnow with these 200 admir and general they can t believ it all i say is this general georg patton general dougla macarthur are spin in their grave at the stupid of what we re do in the middl east
p2442
aVi would not use american ground forc in syria i think that would be a veri serious mistak i don t think american troop should be hold territori which is what they would have to do as an occupi forc i don t think that is a smart strategi
p2443
aVi do think the use of special forc which we re use the use of enabl and trainer in iraq which has had some posit effect are veri much in our interest and so i do support what is happen but let me just
p2444
aVand that s what i want to talk about
p2445
aVwell martha i hope that by the time i if i m fortun
p2446
aVeveryth
p2447
aVi hope by the time i am presid that we will have push isi out of iraq i do think that there is a good chanc that we can take mosul and you know donald say he know more about isi than the general no he doesn t
p2448
aVthere are a lot of veri import plan go on and some of it is to signal to the sunni in the area as well as kurdish peshmerga fighter that we all need to be in this and that take a lot of plan and prepar
p2449
aVi would go after baghdadi i would specif target baghdadi becaus i think our target of al qaida leader and i was involv in a lot of those oper high classifi one made a differ so i think that could help
p2450
aVi would also consid arm the kurd the kurd have been our best partner in syria as well as iraq and i know there s a lot of concern about that in some circl but i think they should have the equip they need so that kurdish and arab fighter on the ground are the princip way that we take raqqa after push isi out of iraq
p2451
aVyou know what s funni she went over a minut over and you don t stop her when i go one second over it s like a big deal
p2452
aVit s realli it s realli veri interest
p2453
aVabsolut i mean she call our peopl deplor a larg group and irredeem i will be a presid for all of our peopl and i ll be a presid that will turn our inner citi around and will give strength to peopl and will give econom to peopl and will bring job back
p2454
aVbecaus nafta sign by her husband is perhap the greatest disast trade deal in the histori of the world not in this countri it strip us of manufactur job we lost our job we lost our money we lost our plant it is a disast and now she want to sign tpp even though she say now she s for it she call it the gold standard and by the way at the last debat she lie becaus it turn out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn t say it they actual said that she lie ok and she lie but she s lie about a lot of thing
p2455
aVi would be a presid for all of the peopl african american the inner citi devast what s happen to our inner citi she s been talk about it for year as usual she talk about it noth happen she doesn t get it done
p2456
aVsame with the latino american the hispan american the same exact thing they talk they don t get it done you go into the inner citi and you see it s 45 percent poverti african american now 45 percent poverti in the inner citi the educ is a disast job are essenti nonexist
p2457
aVi mean it s you know and i ve been say at big speech where i have 20 000 and 30 000 peopl what do you have to lose it can t get ani wors and she s been talk about the inner citi for 25 year noth s go to ever happen
p2458
aVlet me tell you if she s presid of the unit state noth s go to happen it s just go to be talk and all of her friend the tax we were talk about and i would just get it by osmosi she s not do ani me favor but by do all the other favor she s do me favor
p2459
aVwell like everyon els i ve spent a lot of time think over the last 48 hour about what we heard and saw you know with prior republican nomine for presid i disagre with them on polit polici principl but i never question their fit to serv
p2460
aVbut i will tell you she s all talk it doesn t get done all you have to do is take a look at her senat run take a look at upstat new york
p2461
aVit turn out to be a disast
p2462
aVwell 67 percent of the peopl vote to re elect me when i ran for my second term and i was veri proud and veri humbl by that
p2463
aVmr carter i have tri my entir life to do what i can to support children and famili you know right out of law school i went to work for the children s defens fund and donald talk a lot about you know the 30 year i ve been in public servic i m proud of that you know i start off as a young lawyer work against discrimin against african american children in school and in the crimin justic system i work to make sure that kid with disabl could get a public educ someth that i care veri much about i have work with latino one of my first job in polit was down in south texa regist latino citizen to be abl to vote so i have a deep devot to use your absolut correct word to make sure that an everi american feel like he or she has a place in our countri
p2464
aVand i think when you look at the letter that i get a lot of peopl are worri that mayb they wouldn t have a place in donald trump s america they write me and one woman wrote me about her son felix she adopt him from ethiopia when he was a toddler he s 10 year old now this is the onli one countri he s ever known and he listen to donald on tv and he said to his mother one day will he send me back to ethiopia if he get elect
p2465
aVyou know children listen to what is be said to go back to the veri veri first question and there s a lot of fear in fact teacher and parent are call it the trump effect bulli is up a lot of peopl are feel you know uneasi a lot of kid are express their concern
p2466
aVso first and foremost i will do everyth i can to reach out to everybodi
p2467
aVdonald trump is differ i said start back in june that he was not fit to be presid and command in chief and mani republican and independ have said the same thing what we all saw and heard on friday was donald talk about women what he think about women what he doe to women and he has said that the video doesn t repres who he is
p2468
aVdemocrat republican independ peopl across our countri if you don t vote for me i still want to be your presid
p2469
aVi want to be the best presid i can be for everi american
p2470
aVwell within hour i said that i was sorri about the way i talk about that becaus my argument is not with his support it s with him and with the hate and divis campaign that he has run and the incit of violenc at his ralli and the veri brutal kind of comment about not just women but all american all kind of american
p2471
aVand what he has said about african american and latino about muslim about pow about immigr about peopl with disabl he s never apolog for and so i do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said i m proud of the campaign that berni sander and i ran we ran a campaign base on issu not insult and he is support me 100 percent
p2472
aVbecaus we talk about what we want to do we might have had some differ and we had a lot of debat
p2473
aVbut i think it s clear to anyon who heard it that it repres exact who he is becaus we ve seen this throughout the campaign we have seen him insult women we ve seen him rate women on their appear rank them from one to ten we ve seen him embarrass women on tv and on twitter we saw him after the first debat spend near a week denigr a former miss univers in the harshest most person term
p2474
aVbut we believ that we could make the countri better and i was proud of that
p2475
aVwe have a divid nation we have a veri divid nation you look at charlott you look at baltimor you look at the violenc that s take place in the inner citi chicago you take a look at washington d c
p2476
aVwe have an increas in murder within our citi the biggest in 45 year we have a divid nation becaus peopl like her and believ me she has tremend hate in her heart and when she said deplor she meant it and when she said irredeem they re irredeem you didn t mention that but when she said they re irredeem to me that might have been even wors
p2477
aVshe s got tremend she s got tremend hatr and this countri cannot take anoth four year of barack obama and that s what you re get with her
p2478
aVno there wasn t check out a sex tape it was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonder girl scout who was no girl scout
p2479
aVby the way just so you understand when she said 3 o clock in the morn take a look at benghazi she said who is go to answer the call at 3 o clock in the morn guess what she didn t answer it becaus when ambassador steven
p2480
aVso yes this is who donald trump is but it s not onli women and it s not onli this video that rais question about his fit to be our presid becaus he has also target immigr african american latino peopl with disabl pow muslim and so mani other
p2481
aV600 wait a minut anderson 600 time well she said she was awak at 3 o clock in the morn and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o clock in the morn but i won t even mention that but she said she ll be awak who s go the famous thing we re go to answer our call at 3 o clock in the morn guess what happen ambassador steven ambassador steven sent 600 request for help and the onli one she talk to was sidney blumenth who s her friend and not a good guy by the way so you know she shouldn t be talk about that
p2482
aVnow tweet happen to be a modern day form of communic i mean you can like it or not like it i have between facebook and twitter i have almost 25 million peopl it s a veri effect way of communic so you can put it down but it is a veri effect form of communic i m not un proud of it to be honest with you
p2483
aVno
p2484
aVi m shock to hear that
p2485
aVwell it s not onli my opinion it s the opinion of mani other nation secur expert republican former republican member of congress but it s in part becaus those of us who have had the great privileg of see this job up close and know how difficult it is and it s not just becaus i watch my husband take a 300 billion deficit and turn it into a 200 billion surplus and 23 million new job were creat and incom went up for everybodi everybodi african american incom went up 33 percent
p2486
aVand it s not just becaus i work with georg w bush after 9 11 and i was veri proud that when i told him what the citi need what we need to recov he said you ve got it and he never waver he stuck with me
p2487
aVand i have work and i admir presid obama he inherit the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress that was a terribl time for our countri
p2488
aVso this is who donald trump is and the question for us the question our countri must answer is that this is not who we are that s whi to go back to your question i want to send a messag we all should to everi boy and girl and inde to the entir world that america alreadi is great but we are great becaus we are good and we will respect one anoth and we will work with one anoth and we will celebr our divers
p2489
aVnine million peopl lost their job
p2490
aVfive million home were lost
p2491
aVand 13 trillion in famili wealth was wipe out we are back on the right track he would send us back into recess with his tax plan that benefit the wealthiest of american
p2492
aVwe have the slowest growth sinc 1929
p2493
aVit is our countri has the slowest growth and job are a disast
p2494
aVthese are veri import valu to me becaus this is the america that i know and love and i can pledg to you tonight that this is the america that i will serv if i m so fortun enough to becom your presid
p2495
aVthank you well you re right this is one of the most import issu in this elect i want to appoint suprem court justic who understand the way the world realli work who have real life experi who have not just been in a big law firm and mayb clerk for a judg and then gotten on the bench but you know mayb they tri some more case they actual understand what peopl are up against
p2496
aVbecaus i think the current court has gone in the wrong direct and so i would want to see the suprem court revers citizen unit and get dark unaccount money out of our polit donald doesn t agre with that
p2497
aVi would like the suprem court to understand that vote right are still a big problem in mani part of our countri that we don t alway do everyth we can to make it possibl for peopl of color and older peopl and young peopl to be abl to exercis their franchis i want a suprem court that will stick with roe v wade and a woman s right to choos and i want a suprem court that will stick with marriag equal
p2498
aVnow donald has put forth the name of some peopl that he would consid and among the one that he has suggest are peopl who would revers roe v wade and revers marriag equal i think that would be a terribl mistak and would take us backward
p2499
aVi want a suprem court that doesn t alway side with corpor interest i want a suprem court that understand becaus you re wealthi and you can give more money to someth doesn t mean you have ani more right or should have ani more right than anybodi els
p2500
aVso i have veri clear view about what i want to see to kind of chang the balanc on the suprem court and i regret deepli that the senat has not done it job and they have not permit a vote on the person that presid obama a high qualifi person they ve not given him a vote to be abl to be have the full complement of nine suprem court justic i think that was a derelict of duti
p2501
aVi hope that they will see their way to do it but if i am so fortun enough as to be presid i will immedi move to make sure that we fill that we have nine justic that get to work on behalf of our peopl
p2502
aVwell thank you are you a teacher yes i think that that s a veri good question becaus i ve heard from lot of teacher and parent about some of their concern about some of the thing that are be said and done in this campaign
p2503
aVjustic scalia great judg die recent and we have a vacanc i am look to appoint judg veri much in the mold of justic scalia i m look for judg and i ve actual pick 20 of them so that peopl would see high respect high thought of and actual veri beauti review by just about everybodi
p2504
aVbut peopl that will respect the constitut of the unit state and i think that this is so import also the second amend which is total under sieg by peopl like hillari clinton they ll respect the second amend and what it stand for what it repres so import to me
p2505
aVnow hillari mention someth about contribut just so you understand so i will have in my race more than 100 million put in of my money mean i m not take all of this big money from all of these differ corpor like she s do what i ask is this
p2506
aVso i m put in more than by the time it s finish i ll have more than 100 million invest pretti much self fund money we re rais money for the republican parti and we re do tremend on the small donat 61 averag or so
p2507
aVi ask hillari whi doesn t she made 250 million by be in offic she use the power of her offic to make a lot of money whi isn t she fund not for 100 million but whi don t you put 10 million or 20 million or 25 million or 30 million into your own campaign
p2508
aVit s 30 million less for special interest that will tell you exact what to do and it would realli i think be a nice sign to the american public whi aren t you put some money in you have a lot of it you ve made a lot of it becaus of the fact that you ve been in offic made a lot of it while you were secretari of state actual so whi aren t you put money into your own campaign i m just curious
p2509
aVwell
p2510
aVthe question was about the suprem court and i just want to quick say i respect the second amend but i believ there should be comprehens background check and we should close the gun show loophol and close the onlin loophol
p2511
aVam i allow to respond to that i assum i am
p2512
aVwe have to save as mani live as we possibl can
p2513
aVabsolut i think it s such a great question becaus energi is under sieg by the obama administr under absolut sieg the epa environment protect agenc is kill these energi compani and foreign compani are now come in buy our buy so mani of our differ plant and then re jigger the plant so that they can take care of their oil
p2514
aVwe are kill absolut kill our energi busi in this countri now i m all for altern form of energi includ wind includ solar et cetera but we need much more than wind and solar
p2515
aVand you look at our miner hillari clinton want to put all the miner out of busi there is a thing call clean coal coal will last for 1 000 year in this countri now we have natur gas and so mani other thing becaus of technolog we have unbeliev we have found over the last seven year we have found tremend wealth right under our feet so good especi when you have 20 trillion in debt
p2516
aVi will bring our energi compani back they ll be abl to compet they ll make money they ll pay off our nation debt they ll pay off our tremend budget deficit which are tremend but we are put our energi compani out of busi we have to bring back our worker
p2517
aVyou take a look at what s happen to steel and the cost of steel and china dump vast amount of steel all over the unit state which essenti is kill our steelwork and our steel compani we have to guard our energi compani we have to make it possibl
p2518
aVthe epa is so restrict that they are put our energi compani out of busi and all you have to do is go to a great place like west virginia or place like ohio which is phenomen or place like pennsylvania and you see what they re do to the peopl miner and other in the energi busi it s a disgrac
p2519
aVit s an absolut disgrac
p2520
aVand actual well that was veri interest first of all china is illeg dump steel in the unit state and donald trump is buy it to build his build put steelwork and american steel plant out of busi that s someth that i fought against as a senat and that i would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don t get taken advantag of by china on steel or anyth els
p2521
aVyou know becaus it sound like you re in the busi or you re awar of peopl in the busi you know that we are now for the first time ever energi independ we are not depend upon the middl east but the middl east still control a lot of the price so the price of oil has been way down and that has had a damag effect on a lot of the oil compani right we are howev produc a lot of natur gas which serv as a bridg to more renew fuel and i think that s an import transit
p2522
aVwe ve got to remain energi independ it give us much more power and freedom than to be worri about what goe on in the middl east we have enough worri over there without have to worri about that
p2523
aVso i have a comprehens energi polici but it realli doe includ fight climat chang becaus i think that is a serious problem and i support move toward more clean renew energi as quick as we can becaus i think we can be the 21st centuri clean energi superpow and creat million of new job and busi
p2524
aVbut i also want to be sure that we don t leav peopl behind that s whi i m the onli candid from the veri begin of this campaign who had a plan to help us revit coal countri becaus those coal miner and their father and their grandfath they dug that coal out a lot of them lost their live they were injur but they turn the light on and they power their factori i don t want to walk away from them so we ve got to do someth for them
p2525
aVit s just word folk it s just word those word i ve been hear them for mani year i heard them when they were run for the senat in new york where hillari was go to bring back job to upstat new york and she fail
p2526
aVbut the price of coal is down worldwid so we have to look at this comprehens
p2527
aVand that s exact what i have propos i hope you will go to hillaryclinton com and look at my entir polici
p2528
aVi ve heard them where hillari is constant talk about the inner citi of our countri which are a disast educ wise jobwis safeti wise in everi way possibl i m go to help the african american i m go to help the latino hispan i am go to help the inner citi
p2529
aVwell i certain will becaus i think that s a veri fair and import question look i respect his children his children are incred abl and devot and i think that say a lot about donald i don t agre with near anyth els he say or doe but i do respect that and i think that is someth that as a mother and a grandmoth is veri import to me
p2530
aVso i believ that this elect has becom in part so so conflict orient so intens becaus there s a lot at stake this is not an ordinari time and this is not an ordinari elect we are go to be choos a presid who will set polici for not just four or eight year but becaus of some of the import decis we have to make here at home and around the world from the suprem court to energi and so much els and so there is a lot at stake it s one of the most consequenti elect that we ve had
p2531
aVand that s whi i ve tri to put forth specif polici and plan tri to get it off of the person and put it on to what it is i want to do as presid and that s whi i hope peopl will check on that for themselv so that they can see that yes i ve spent 30 year actual mayb a littl more work to help kid and famili and i want to take all that experi to the white hous and do that everi singl day
p2532
aVwell i consid her statement about my children to be a veri nice compliment i don t know if it was meant to be a compliment but it is a great i m veri proud of my children and they ve done a wonder job and they ve been wonder wonder kid so i consid that a compliment
p2533
aVi will say this about hillari she doesn t quit she doesn t give up i respect that i tell it like it is she s a fighter i disagre with much of what she s fight for i do disagre with her judgment in mani case but she doe fight hard and she doesn t quit and she doesn t give up and i consid that to be a veri good trait
p2534
aVshe s done a terribl job for the african american she want their vote and she doe noth and then she come back four year later we saw that firsthand when she was unit state senat she campaign where the primari part of her campaign
p2535
aVso she s allow to do that but i m not allow to respond
p2536
aVsound fair
p2537
aVand i think it is veri import for us to make clear to our children that our countri realli is great becaus we re good and we are go to respect one anoth lift each other up we are go to be look for way to celebr our divers and we are go to tri to reach out to everi boy and girl as well as everi adult to bring them in to work on behalf of our countri
p2538
aVit was locker room talk as i told you that was locker room talk i m not proud of it i am a person who has great respect for peopl for my famili for the peopl of this countri and certain i m not proud of it but that was someth that happen
p2539
aVif you look at bill clinton far wors mine are word and his was action his was what he s done to women there s never been anybodi in the histori polit in this nation that s been so abus to women so you can say ani way you want to say it but bill clinton was abus to women
p2540
aVhillari clinton attack those same women and attack them vicious four of them here tonight one of the women who is a wonder woman at 12 year old was rape at 12 her client she repres got him off and she s seen laugh on two separ occas laugh at the girl who was rape kathi shelton that young woman is here with us tonight
p2541
aVso don t tell me about word i am absolut i apolog for those word but it is thing that peopl say but what presid clinton did he was impeach he lost his licens to practic law he had to pay an 850 000 fine to one of the women paula jone who s also here tonight
p2542
aVand i will tell you that when hillari bring up a point like that and she talk about word that i said 11 year ago i think it s disgrac and i think she should be asham of herself if you want to know the truth
p2543
aVwell first let me start by say that so much of what he s just said is not right but he get to run his campaign ani way he choos he get to decid what he want to talk about instead of answer peopl s question talk about our agenda lay out the plan that we have that we think can make a better life and a better countri that s his choic
p2544
aVwhen i hear someth like that i am remind of what my friend michell obama advis us all when they go low you go high
p2545
aVand look if this were just about one video mayb what he s say tonight would be understand but everyon can draw their own conclus at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respect women but he never apolog for anyth to anyon
p2546
aVi have a veri posit and optimist view about what we can do togeth that s whi the slogan of my campaign is stronger togeth becaus i think if we work togeth if we overcom the divis that sometim set american against one anoth and instead we make some big goal and i ve set forth some big goal get the economi to work for everyon not just those at the top make sure that we have the best educ system from preschool through colleg and make it afford and so much els
p2547
aVhe never apolog to mr and mrs khan the gold star famili whose son captain khan die in the line of duti in iraq and donald insult and attack them for week over their religion
p2548
aVhe never apolog to the distinguish feder judg who was born in indiana but donald said he couldn t be trust to be a judg becaus his parent were quot mexican
p2549
aVhe never apolog to the report that he mimick and mock on nation televis and our children were watch and he never apolog for the racist lie that presid obama was not born in the unit state of america he owe the presid an apolog he owe our countri an apolog and he need to take respons for his action and his word
p2550
aVwell you owe the presid an apolog becaus as you know veri well your campaign sidney blumenth he s anoth real winner that you have and he s the one that got this start along with your campaign manag and they were on televis just two week ago she was say exact that so you realli owe him an apolog you re the one that sent the pictur around your campaign sent the pictur around with presid obama in a certain garb that was long befor i was ever involv so you actual owe an apolog
p2551
aVnumber two michell obama i ve gotten to see the commerci that they did on you and i ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commerci i ve ever seen of michell obama talk about you hillari
p2552
aVso you talk about friend go back and take a look at those commerci a race where you lost fair and squar unlik the berni sander race where you won but not fair and squar in my opinion and all you have to do is take a look at wikileak and just see what they say about berni sander and see what deborah wasserman schultz had in mind becaus berni sander between super deleg and deborah wasserman schultz he never had a chanc and i was so surpris to see him sign on with the devil
p2553
aVbut when you talk about apolog i think the one that you should realli be apolog for and the thing that you should be apolog for are the 33 000 e mail that you delet and that you acid wash and then the two box of e mail and other thing last week that were taken from an offic and are now miss
p2554
aVand i ll tell you what i didn t think i d say this but i m go to say it and i hate to say it but if i win i am go to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situat becaus there has never been so mani lie so much decept there has never been anyth like it and we re go to have a special prosecutor
p2555
aVwhen i speak i go out and speak the peopl of this countri are furious in my opinion the peopl that have been long term worker at the fbi are furious there has never been anyth like this where e mail and you get a subpoena you get a subpoena and after get the subpoena you delet 33 000 e mail and then you acid wash them or bleach them as you would say veri expens process
p2556
aVso we re go to get a special prosecutor and we re go to look into it becaus you know what peopl have been their live have been destroy for do one fifth of what you ve done and it s a disgrac and honest you ought to be asham of yourself
p2557
aVif we set those goal and we go togeth to tri to achiev them there s noth in my opinion that america can t do so that s whi i hope that we will come togeth in this campaign obvious i m hope to earn your vote i m hope to be elect in novemb and i can promis you i will work with everi american
p2558
aVbecaus everyth he just said is absolut fals but i m not surpris
p2559
aVoh realli
p2560
aVin the first debat
p2561
aVi told peopl that it would be imposs to be fact check donald all the time i d never get to talk about anyth i want to do and how we re go to realli make live better for peopl
p2562
aVso onc again go to hillaryclinton com we have liter trump you can fact check him in real time last time at the first debat we had million of peopl fact check so i expect we ll have million more fact check becaus you know it is it s just aw good that someon with the tempera of donald trump is not in charg of the law in our countri
p2563
aVbecaus you d be in jail
p2564
aVi want to be the presid for all american regardless of your polit belief where you come from what you look like your religion i want us to heal our countri and bring it togeth becaus that s i think the best way for us to get the futur that our children and our grandchildren deserv
p2565
aVwell martha first let me say and i ve said befor but i ll repeat it becaus i want everyon to hear it that was a mistak and i take respons for use a person e mail account obvious if i were to do it over again i would not i m not make ani excus it was a mistak and i am veri sorri about that
p2566
aVbut i think it s also import to point out where there are some mislead accus from critic and other after a year long investig there is no evid that anyon hack the server i was use and there is no evid that anyon can point to at all anyon who say otherwis has no basi that ani classifi materi end up in the wrong hand
p2567
aVi take classifi materi veri serious and alway have when i was on the senat arm servic committe i was privi to a lot of classifi materi obvious as secretari of state i had some of the most import secret that we possess such as go after bin laden so i am veri commit to take classifi inform serious and as i said there is no evid that ani classifi inform end up in the wrong hand
p2568
aVand yet she didn t know the word the letter c on a document right she didn t even know what that word what that letter meant
p2569
aVyou know it s amaz i m watch hillari go over fact and she s go after fact after fact and she s lie again becaus she said she you know what she did with the e mail was fine you think it was fine to delet 33 000 e mail i don t think so
p2570
aVshe said the 33 000 e mail had to do with her daughter s wed number one and a yoga class well mayb we ll give three or three or four or five or someth 33 000 e mail delet and now she s say there wasn t anyth wrong
p2571
aVand more import that was after get a subpoena that wasn t befor that was after she got it from the unit state congress and i ll be honest i am so disappoint in congressmen includ republican for allow this to happen
p2572
aVour justic depart where our husband goe on to the back of a airplan for 39 minut talk to the attorney general day befor a rule is go to be made on her case but for you to say that there was noth wrong with you delet 39 000 e mail again you should be asham of yourself what you did and this is after get a subpoena from the unit state congress
p2573
aVyou did that wait a minut one second
p2574
aVif you did that in the privat sector you d be put in jail let alon after get a subpoena from the unit state congress
p2575
aVlook it s just not true and so pleas go to
p2576
aVoh you didn t delet them
p2577
aVyou know i think when we talk about the suprem court it realli rais the central issu in this elect name what kind of countri are we go to be what kind of opportun will we provid for our citizen what kind of right will american have
p2578
aVveri unfair that somebodi run across the border becom a citizen under her plan you have open border you would have a disast on trade and you will have a disast with your open border
p2579
aVbut what she doesn t say is that presid obama has deport million and million of peopl just the way it is
p2580
aVwe will not have open border that is
p2581
aVthat is a rank mischaracter
p2582
aVwe will have secur border but we ll also have reform and this use to be a bipartisan issu ronald reagan was the last presid
p2583
aVand i feel strong that the suprem court need to stand on the side of the american peopl not on the side of the power corpor and the wealthi for me that mean that we need a suprem court that will stand up on behalf of women s right on behalf of the right of the lgbt communiti that will stand up and say no to citizen unit a decis that has undermin the elect system in our countri becaus of the way it permit dark unaccount money to come into our elector system
p2584
aVto sign immigr reform and georg w bush support it as well
p2585
aVthank you
p2586
aVwell if you went on to read the rest of the sentenc i was talk about energi you know we trade more energi with our neighbor than we trade with the rest of the world combin and i do want us to have an electr grid an energi system that cross border i think that would be a great benefit to us
p2587
aVbut you are veri clear quot from wikileak and what s realli import about wikileak is that the russian govern has engag in espionag against american they have hack american websit american account of privat peopl of institut then they have given that inform to wikileak for the purpos of put it on the internet
p2588
aVthis has come from the highest level of the russian govern clear from putin himself in an effort as 17 of our intellig agenc have confirm to influenc our elect
p2589
aVso i actual think the most import question of this even chris is final will donald trump admit and condemn that the russian are do this and make it clear that he will not have the help of putin in in this elect that he reject russian espionag against american which he actual encourag in the past those are the question we need answer we ve never had anyth like this happen in ani of our elect befor
p2590
aVthat was a great pivot off the fact that she want open border ok how did we get on to putin
p2591
aVi have major disagr with my oppon about these issu and other that will be befor the suprem court but i feel that at this point in our countri s histori it is import that we not revers marriag equal that we not revers roe v wade that we stand up against citizen unit we stand up for the right of peopl in the workplac that we stand up and basic say the suprem court should repres all of us
p2592
aVso just to finish on the border
p2593
aVshe want open border peopl are go to pour into our countri peopl are go to come in from syria she want 550 percent more peopl than barack obama and he has thousand and thousand of peopl they have no idea where they come from
p2594
aVand you see we are go to stop radic islam terror in this countri she won t even mention the word and neither will presid obama so i just want to tell you she want open border
p2595
aVnow we can talk about putin i don t know putin he said nice thing about me if we got along well that would be good if russia and the unit state got along well and went after isi that would be good
p2596
aVhe has no respect for her he has no respect for our presid and i ll tell you what we re in veri serious troubl becaus we have a countri with tremend number of nuclear warhead 1 800 by the way where they expand and we didn t 1 800 nuclear warhead and she s play chicken look putin
p2597
aVfrom everyth i see has no respect for this person
p2598
aVwell that s becaus he d rather have a puppet as presid of the unit state
p2599
aVthat s how i see the court and the kind of peopl that i would be look to nomin to the court would be in the great tradit of stand up to the power stand up on behalf of our right as american
p2600
aVno puppet no puppet
p2601
aVand it s pretti clear
p2602
aVyou re the puppet
p2603
aVit s pretti clear you won t admit
p2604
aVno you re the puppet
p2605
aVthat the russian have engag in cyberattack against the unit state of america that you encourag espionag against our peopl that you are will to spout the putin line sign up for his wish list break up nato do whatev he want to do and that you continu to get help from him becaus he has a veri clear favorit in this race
p2606
aVso i think that this is such an unpreced situat we ve never had a foreign govern tri to interfer in our elect we have 17 17 intellig agenc civilian and militari who have all conclud that these espionag attack these cyberattack come from the highest level of the kremlin and they are design to influenc our elect i find that deepli disturb
p2607
aVand i think it s time you take a stand
p2608
aVshe has no idea whether it s russia china or anybodi els
p2609
aVand i look forward to have that opportun i would hope that the senat would do it job and confirm the nomine that presid obama has sent to them that s the way the constitut fundament should oper the presid nomin and then the senat advis and consent or not but they go forward with the process
p2610
aVi am not quot myself
p2611
aVshe has no idea
p2612
aVi am quot 17
p2613
aVhillari you have no idea
p2614
aV17 intellig do you doubt 17 militari and civilian
p2615
aVand our countri has no idea
p2616
aVagenc
p2617
aVyeah i doubt it i doubt it
p2618
aVwell he d rather believ vladimir putin than the militari and civilian intellig profession who are sworn to protect us i find that just absolut
p2619
aVshe doesn t like putin becaus putin has outsmart her at everi step of the way
p2620
aVexcus me putin has outsmart her in syria
p2621
aVhe s outsmart her everi step of the way
p2622
aVyes that s fine
p2623
aVby russia or anybodi els
p2624
aVof cours i condemn of cours i i don t know putin i have no idea
p2625
aVi never met putin this is not my best friend but if the unit state got along with russia wouldn t be so bad
p2626
aVlet me tell you putin has outsmart her and obama at everi singl step of the way whether it s syria you name it missil take a look at the start up that they sign the russian have said accord to mani mani report i can t believ they allow us to do this they creat warhead and we can t the russian can t believ it she has been outsmart by putin
p2627
aVand all you have to do is look at the middl east they ve taken over we ve spent 6 trillion they ve taken over the middl east she has been outsmart and outplay wors than anybodi i ve ever seen in ani govern whatsoev
p2628
aVand she alway will be
p2629
aVi i find it iron that he s rais nuclear weapon this is a person who has been veri cavali even casual about the use of nuclear weapon he s
p2630
aVwrong
p2631
aVadvoc more countri get them japan korea even saudi arabia he said well if we have them whi don t we use them which i think is terrifi
p2632
aVbut here s the deal the bottom line on nuclear weapon is that when the presid give the order it must be follow there s about four minut between the order be given and the peopl respons for launch nuclear weapon to do so and that s whi 10 peopl who have had that awesom respons have come out and in an unpreced way said they would not trust donald trump with the nuclear code or to have his finger on the nuclear button

p2636
aVall i said is we have to renegoti these agreement becaus our countri cannot afford to defend saudi arabia japan germani south korea and mani other place we cannot continu to afford she took that as say nuclear weapon
p2637
aVlook she s been proven to be a liar on so mani differ way this is just anoth lie
p2638
aVwell i m just quot you when you were ask
p2639
aVthere s no quot you re not go to find a quot from me
p2640
aVabout a potenti nuclear nuclear competit in asia you said you know go ahead enjoy yourselv folk that kind
p2641
aVand defend yourselv
p2642
aVsometh happen recent where justic ginsburg made some veri veri inappropri statement toward me and toward a tremend number of peopl mani mani million of peopl that i repres and she was forc to apolog and apolog she did but these were statement that should never ever have been made
p2643
aVof languag well
p2644
aVand defend yourselv i didn t say nuclear and defend yourself
p2645
aVthe unit state has kept the peac the unit state has kept the peac through our allianc donald want to tear up our allianc i think it make the world safer and frank it make the unit state safer i would work with our alli in asia in europ in the middl east and elsewher that s the onli way we re go to be abl to keep the peac
p2646
aVyes
p2647
aVwell i think when the middl class thrive america thrive and so my plan is base on grow the economi give middl class famili mani more opportun i want us to have the biggest job program sinc world war ii job in infrastructur and advanc manufactur i think we can compet with high wage countri and i believ we should new job and clean energi not onli to fight climat chang which is a serious problem but to creat new opportun and new busi
p2648
aVi want us to do more to help small busi that s where two third of the new job are go to come from i want us to rais the nation minimum wage becaus peopl who live in poverti should not who work full time should not still be in poverti and i sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do
p2649
aVi feel strong that we have to have an educ system that start with preschool and goe through colleg that s whi i want more technic educ in high school and in communiti colleg real apprenticeship to prepar young peopl for the job of the futur i want to make colleg debt free and for famili make less than 125 000 you will not get a tuition bill from a public colleg or univers if the plan that i work on with berni sander is enact
p2650
aVand we re go to work hard to make sure that it is becaus we are go to go where the money is most of the gain in the last year sinc the great recess have gone to the veri top so we are go to have the wealthi pay their fair share we re go to have corpor make a contribut greater than they are now to our countri
p2651
aVwe need a suprem court that in my opinion is go to uphold the second amend and all amend but the second amend which is under absolut sieg i believ if my oppon should win this race which i truli don t think will happen we will have a second amend which will be a veri veri small replica of what it is right now but i feel that it s absolut import that we uphold becaus of the fact that it is under such trauma
p2652
aVthat is a plan that has been analyz by independ expert which said that it could produc 10 million new job by contrast donald s plan has been analyz to conclud it might lose 3 5 million job whi becaus his whole plan is to cut tax to give the biggest tax break ever to the wealthi and to corpor ad 20 trillion to our debt and caus the kind of disloc that we have seen befor becaus it truli will be trickl down econom on steroid
p2653
aVso the plan i have i think will actual produc greater opportun the plan he has will cost us job and possibl lead to anoth great recess
p2654
aVwell first of all befor i start on my plan her plan is go to rais tax and even doubl your tax her tax plan is a disast and she can say all she want about colleg tuition and i m a big propon we re go to do a lot of thing for colleg tuition but the rest of the public s go to be pay for it we will have a massiv massiv tax increas under hillari clinton s plan
p2655
aVbut i d like to start off where we left becaus when i said japan and germani and i m not to singl them out but south korea these are veri rich power countri saudi arabia noth but money we protect saudi arabia whi aren t they pay
p2656
aVshe immedi when she heard this i question it and i question nato whi aren t the nato question whi aren t they pay becaus they weren t pay
p2657
aVsinc i did this this was a year ago all of a sudden they re pay and i ve been given a lot a lot of credit for it all of a sudden they re start to pay up they have to pay up we re protect peopl they have to pay up and i m a big fan of nato but they have to pay up
p2658
aVshe come out and said we love our alli we think our alli are great well it s aw hard to get them to pay up when you have somebodi say we think how great they are
p2659
aVwe have to tell japan in a veri nice way we have to tell germani all of these countri south korea we have to say you have to help us out we have dure his regim dure presid obama s regim we ve doubl our nation debt we re up to 20 trillion
p2660
aVso my plan we re go to renegoti trade deal we re go to have a lot of free trade we re go to have free trade more free trade than we have right now but we have horribl deal our job are be taken out by the deal that her husband sign nafta one of the worst deal ever our job are be suck out of our economi
p2661
aVi feel that the justic that i am go to appoint and i ve name 20 of them the justic that i m go to appoint will be pro life they will have a conserv bent they will be protect the second amend they are great scholar in all case and they re peopl of tremend respect they will interpret the constitut the way the founder want it interpret and i believ that s veri veri import
p2662
aVyou look at all of the place that i just left you go to pennsylvania you go to ohio you go to florida you go to ani of them you go upstat new york our job have fled to mexico and other place we re bring our job back
p2663
aVi am go to renegoti nafta and if i can t make a great deal then we re go to termin nafta and we re go to creat new deal we re go to have trade but we re go we re go to termin it we re go to make a great trade deal
p2664
aVand if we can t we re go to do it we re go to go a separ way becaus it has been a disast we are go to cut tax massiv we re go to cut busi tax massiv they re go to start hire peopl we re go to bring the 2 5 trillion
p2665
aVthat s offshor back into the countri we are go to start the engin roll again becaus
p2666
aVright now our countri is die at 1 percent gdp
p2667
aVwell let me translat that if i can chris becaus
p2668
aVyou can t
p2669
aVthe fact is he s go to advoc for the largest tax cut we ve ever seen three time more than the tax cut under the bush administr i have said repeat throughout this campaign i will not rais tax on anyon make 250 000 or less
p2670
aVi don t think we should have justic appoint that decid what they want to hear it s all about the constitut of of and so import the constitut the way it was meant to be and those are the peopl that i will appoint
p2671
aVi also will not add a penni to the debt i have cost out what i m go to do he will through his massiv tax cut add 20 trillion to the debt
p2672
aVwell he mention the debt we know how to get control of the debt when my husband was presid we went from a 300 billion deficit to a 200 billion surplus and we were actual on the path to elimin the nation debt when presid obama came into offic he inherit the worst econom disast sinc the great depress he has cut the deficit by two third
p2673
aVso yes one of the way you go after the debt one of the way you creat job is by invest in peopl so i do have invest invest in new job invest in educ skill train and the opportun for peopl to get ahead and stay ahead that s the kind of approach that will work
p2674
aVcut tax on the wealthi we ve tri that it has not work the way that it has been promis
p2675
aVcorrect
p2676
aVwell it s a combin chris and let me say that when you inherit the level of econom catastroph that presid obama inherit it was a real touch and go situat i was in the senat befor i becam secretari of state i ve never seen peopl as physic distraught as the bush administr team was becaus of what was happen to the economi
p2677
aVi person believ that the step that presid obama took save the economi he doesn t get the credit he deserv for take some veri hard posit but it was a terribl recess
p2678
aVso now we ve dug ourselv out of it we re stand but we re not yet run so what i am propos is that we invest from the middl out and the ground up not the top down that is not go to work
p2679
aVthat s whi what i have put forward doesn t add a penni to the debt but it is the kind of approach that will enabl more peopl to take those new job higher pay job we re begin to see some increas in incom and we certain have had a long string of increas job we ve got to do more to get the whole economi move and that s what i believ i will be abl to do
p2680
aVover a 10 year period
p2681
aVso i just left some high repres of india they re grow at 8 percent china is grow at 7 percent and that for them is a catastroph low number
p2682
aVwe are grow our last report came out and it s right around the 1 percent level and i think it s go down last week as you know the end of last week they came out with an anem job report a terribl job report in fact i said is that the last job report befor the elect becaus if it is i should win easili it was so bad the report was so bad
p2683
aVlook our countri is stagnant we ve lost our job we ve lost our busi we re not make thing anymor relat speak our product is pour in from china pour in from vietnam pour in from all over the world
p2684
aVi ve visit so mani communiti this has been such an incred educ for me chris i ve gotten to know so mani i ve develop so mani friend over the last year and they cri when they see what s happen i pass factori that were thrive 20 25 year ago and becaus of the bill that her husband sign and she bless 100 percent it is just horribl what s happen to these peopl in these communiti
p2685
aVnow she can say that her husband did well but boy did they suffer as nafta kick in becaus it didn t realli kick in veri much but it kick in after they left boy did they suffer that was one of the worst thing that s ever been sign by our countri
p2686
aVnow she want to sign tran pacif partnership and she want it she lie when she said she didn t call it the gold standard in one of the debat she total lie she did call it the gold standard and they actual fact check and they said i was right i was so honor
p2687
aVand that will be as bad as nafta
p2688
aVwell first let me say number one when i saw the final agreement for tpp i said i was against it it didn t meet my test i ve had the same test doe it creat job rais incom and further our nation secur i m against it now i ll be against it after the elect i ll be against it when i m presid
p2689
aVthere s onli one of us on this stage who s actual ship job to mexico becaus that s donald he s ship job to 12 countri includ mexico
p2690
aVbut he mention china and you know one of the biggest problem we have with china is the illeg dump of steel and aluminum into our market i have fought against that as a senat i ve stood up against it as secretari of state
p2691
aVdonald has bought chines steel and aluminum in fact the trump hotel right here in las vega was made with chines steel so he goe around with crocodil tear about how terribl it is but he has given job to chines steelwork not american steelwork
p2692
aVthat s the kind of approach that is just not go to work
p2693
aVwell let me just say let me just say
p2694
aVwe re go to pull the countri togeth we re go to have trade agreement that we enforc that s whi i m go to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in histori and we re go to enforc those agreement and we re go to look for busi to help us by buy american product
p2695
aVlet me ask a simpl question she s been do this for 30 year whi the hell didn t you do it over the last 15 20 year
p2696
aVno i vote
p2697
aVyou were veri much involv excus me my turn you were veri much involv in everi aspect of this countri veri much and you do have experi i say the one thing you have over me is experi but it s bad experi becaus what you ve done has turn out bad
p2698
aVfor 30 year you ve been in a posit to help and if you say that i use steel or i use someth els i make it imposs for me to do that i wouldn t mind
p2699
aVthe problem is you talk but you don t get anyth done hillari you don t just like when you ran the state depart 6 billion was miss how do you miss 6 billion you ran the state depart 6 billion was either stolen they don t know it s gone 6 billion if you becom presid this countri is go to be in some mess believ me
p2700
aVwell first of all what he just said about the state depart is not onli untru it s been debunk numer time
p2701
aVwell first of all i support the second amend i live in arkansa for 18 wonder year i repres upstat new york i understand and respect the tradit of gun ownership it goe back to the found of our countri
p2702
aVbut i think it s realli an import issu he rais the 30 year of experi so let me just talk briefli about that you know back in the 1970s i work for the children s defens fund and i was take on discrimin against african american kid in school he was get su by the justic depart for racial discrimin in his apart build
p2703
aVin the 1980s i was work to reform the school in arkansa he was borrow 14 million from his father to start his busi in the 1990s i went to beij and i said women s right are human right he insult a former miss univers alicia machado call her an eat machin
p2704
aVgive me a break
p2705
aVand on the day when i was in the situat room monitor the raid that brought osama bin laden to justic he was host the celebr apprentic so i m happi to compar my 30 year of experi what i ve done for this countri tri to help in everi way i could especi kid and famili get ahead and stay ahead with your 30 year and i ll let the american peopl make that decis
p2706
aVwell i think i did a much better job i built a massiv compani a great compani some of the greatest asset anywher in the world worth mani mani billion of dollar i start with a 1 million loan i agre with that it s a 1 million loan but i built a phenomen compani
p2707
aVand if we could run our countri the way i ve run my compani we would have a countri that you would be so proud of you would even be proud of it
p2708
aVand frank when you look at her real record take a look at syria take a look at the migrat take a look at libya take a look at iraq she gave us isi becaus her and obama creat this huge vacuum and a small group came out of that huge vacuum becaus when we should never have been in iraq but onc we were there we should have never got out the way they want to get out she gave us isi as sure as you are sit there and what happen is now isi is in 32 countri and now i listen how she s go to get rid of isi she s go to get rid of nobodi
p2709
aVbut i also believ that there can be and must be reason regul becaus i support the second amend doesn t mean that i want peopl who shouldn t have gun to be abl to threaten you kill you or member of your famili
p2710
aVwell first of all those stori have been larg debunk those peopl i don t know those peopl i have a feel how they came i believ it was her campaign that did it
p2711
aVjust like if you look at what came out today on the clip where i was wonder what happen with my ralli in chicago and other ralli where we had such violenc she s the one and obama that caus the violenc they hire peopl they paid them 1 500 and they re on tape say be violent caus fight do bad thing
p2712
aVi would say the onli way becaus those stori are all total fals i have to say that and i didn t even apolog to my wife who s sit right here becaus i didn t do anyth i didn t know ani of these i didn t see these women
p2713
aVthese women the woman on the plane the i think they want either fame or her campaign did it and i think it s her campaign becaus what i saw what they did which is a crimin act by the way where they re tell peopl to go out and start fist fight and start violenc
p2714
aVand i ll tell you what in particular in chicago peopl were hurt and peopl could have been kill in that riot and that was now all on tape start by her i believ chris that she got these peopl to step forward if it wasn t they get their 10 minut of fame but they were all total it was all fiction it was lie and it was fiction
p2715
aVwell
p2716
aVat the last debat we heard donald talk about what he did to women and after that a number of women have come forward say that s exact what he did to them now what was his respons well he held a number of big ralli where he said that he could not possibl have done those thing to those women becaus they were not attract enough for them to be assault
p2717
aVi did not say that i did not say that
p2718
aVin fact he went on to say
p2719
aVand so when i think about what we need to do we have 33 000 peopl a year who die from gun i think we need comprehens background check need to close the onlin loophol close the gun show loophol there s other matter that i think are sensibl that are the kind of reform that would make a differ that are not in ani way conflict with the second amend
p2720
aVi did not say that
p2721
aVhe went on to say look at her i don t think so about anoth woman he said that wouldn t be my first choic he attack the woman report write the stori call her disgust as he has call a number of women dure this campaign
p2722
aVdonald think belittl women make him bigger he goe after their digniti their self worth and i don t think there is a woman anywher who doesn t know what that feel like so we now know what donald think and what he say and how he act toward women that s who donald is
p2723
aVi think it s realli up to all of us to demonstr who we are and who our countri is and to stand up and be veri clear about what we expect from our next presid how we want to bring our countri togeth where we don t want to have the kind of pit of peopl one against the other where instead we celebr our divers we lift peopl up and we make our countri even greater
p2724
aVamerica is great becaus america is good and it realli is up to all of us to make that true now and in the futur and particular for our children and our grandchildren
p2725
aVnobodi has more respect for women than i do nobodi
p2726
aVnobodi has more respect
p2727
aVyou mention the heller decis and what i was say that you referenc chris was that i disagre with the way the court appli the second amend in that case becaus what the district of columbia was tri to do was to protect toddler from gun and so they want peopl with gun to safe store them and the court didn t accept that reason regul but they ve accept mani other so i see no conflict between save peopl s live and defend the second amend
p2728
aVand frank those stori have been larg debunk and i realli want to just talk about someth slight differ
p2729
aVshe mention this which is all fiction all fiction probabl or possibl start by her and her veri sleazi campaign but i will tell you what isn t fiction are her e mail where she destroy 33 000 e mail crimin crimin after get a subpoena from the unit state congress
p2730
aVwhat happen to the fbi i don t know we have a great general four star general today you read it in all of the paper go to potenti serv five year in jail for lie to the fbi one lie she s lie hundr of time to the peopl to congress and to the fbi he s go to probabl go to jail this is a four star general and she get away with it and she can run for the presid of the unit state that s realli what you should be talk about not fiction where somebodi want fame or where they come out of her crook campaign
p2731
aVwell everi time donald is push on someth which is obvious uncomfort like what these women are say he immedi goe to deni respons and it s not just about women he never apolog or say he s sorri for anyth
p2732
aVso we know what he has said and what he s done to women but he also went after a disabl report mock and mimick him on nation televis
p2733
aVwrong
p2734
aVhe went after mr and mrs khan the parent of a young man who die serv our countri a gold star famili becaus of their religion he went after john mccain a prison of war said he prefer peopl who aren t captur he went after a feder judg born in indiana but who donald said couldn t be trust to tri the fraud and racket case against trump univers becaus his parent were mexican
p2735
aVso it s not one thing this is a pattern a pattern of divis of a veri dark and in mani way danger vision of our countri where he incit violenc where he applaud peopl who are push and pull and punch at his ralli that is not who america is
p2736
aVand i hope that as we move in the last week of this campaign more and more peopl will understand what s at stake in this elect it realli doe come down to what kind of countri we are go to have
p2737
aVso sad when she talk about violenc at my ralli and she caus the violenc it s on tape
p2738
aVthe other thing are fals but honest i d love to talk about get rid of isi and i d love to talk about other thing
p2739
aVbut those other charg as she know are fals
p2740
aVwell everyth i did as secretari of state was in further of our countri s interest and our valu the state depart has said that i think that s been proven
p2741
aVwell the d c vs heller decis was veri strong and she was extrem angri about it i watch i mean she was veri veri angri when upheld and justic scalia was so involv and it was a well craft decis but hillari was extrem upset extrem angri and peopl that believ in the second amend and believ in it veri strong were veri upset with what she had to say
p2742
aVbut i am happi in fact i m thrill to talk about the clinton foundat becaus it is a world renown chariti and i am so proud of the work that it doe you know i could talk for the rest of the debat i know i don t have the time to do that
p2743
aVbut just briefli the clinton foundat made it possibl for 11 million peopl around the world with hiv aid to afford treatment and that s about half all the peopl in the world who are get treatment in partnership with the american health associ
p2744
aVwe have made environ in school healthier for kid includ healthier lunch
p2745
aVwell it is an open discuss and you
p2746
aVwell but there is no but there is no evid but there is
p2747
aVi think that it s been veri well
p2748
aVthere is a lot of evid about the veri good work
p2749
aVit s been veri well studi
p2750
aVand the high rank
p2751
aVand it s a crimin enterpris and so mani peopl know it
p2752
aVit s a crimin enterpris saudi arabia give 25 million qatar all of these countri you talk about women and women s right so these are peopl that push gay off busi off build these are peopl that kill women and treat women horribl and yet you take their money
p2753
aVso i d like to ask you right now whi don t you give back the money that you ve taken from certain countri that treat certain group of peopl so horribl whi don t you give back the money i think it would be a great gestur
p2754
aVbecaus she take a tremend amount of money and you take a look at the peopl of haiti i was at a littl haiti the other day in florida and i want to tell you they hate the clinton becaus what s happen in haiti with the clinton foundat is a disgrac and you know it and they know it and everybodi know it
p2755
aVwell i was upset becaus unfortun dozen of toddler injur themselv even kill peopl with gun becaus unfortun not everyon who has load gun in their home take appropri precaut
p2756
aVwell veri quick we at the clinton foundat spend 90 percent 90 percent of all the money that is donat on behalf of program of peopl around the world and in our own countri i m veri proud of that we have the highest rate from the watchdog that follow foundat and i d be happi to compar what we do with the trump foundat which took money from other peopl and bought a six foot portrait of donald i mean who doe that it just was astonish
p2757
aVbut when it come to haiti haiti is the poorest countri in our hemispher the earthquak and the hurrican it has devast haiti bill and i have been involv in tri to help haiti for mani year the clinton foundat rais 30 million to help haiti after the catastroph earthquak and all of the terribl problem the peopl there had
p2758
aVwe have done thing to help small busi agricultur and so much els and we re go to keep work to help haiti
p2759
aVbecaus it s an import part of the american experi
p2760
aVthey don t want you to help them anymor
p2761
ag657
aVi d like to mention one thing trump foundat small foundat peopl contribut i contribut the money goe 100 percent 100 percent goe to differ chariti includ a lot of militari i don t get anyth i don t buy boat i don t buy plane what happen the money goe to them
p2762
aVbut there s no doubt that i respect the second amend that i also believ there s an individu right to bear arm that is not in conflict with sensibl commonsens regul
p2763
aVno it was we put up the american flag and that s it they put up the american flag we fought for the right in palm beach to put up the american flag
p2764
aVthere was there was and by the way
p2765
aVthe money the money went to fisher hous where they build hous the money that you re talk about went to fisher hous where they build hous for veteran and disabl vet
p2766
aVbut of cours there s no way we can know whether ani of that is true becaus he hasn t releas his tax return he is the first candid ever to run for presid in the last 40 plus year who has not releas his tax return so everyth he say about chariti or anyth els we can t prove it you can look at our tax return we ve got them all out there
p2767
aVbut what is realli troubl is that we learn in the last debat he has not paid a penni in feder incom tax and we were talk about immigr a few minut ago chris you know half of all immigr undocu immigr in our countri actual pay feder incom tax so we have undocu immigr in america who are pay more feder incom tax than a billionair i find that just astonish
p2768
aVso let me just tell you veri quick we re entitl becaus of the law that peopl like her pass to take massiv amount of depreci on other charg and we do it and all of her donor just about all of them i know buffett took hundr of million of dollar soro georg soro took hundr of million of dollar
p2769
aVand you know look i understand that donald s been strong support by the nra the gun lobbi s on his side they re run million of dollar of ad against me and i regret that becaus what i would like to see is for peopl to come togeth and say of cours we re go to protect and defend the second amend but we re go to do it in a way that tri to save some of these 33 000 live that we lose everi year
p2770
aVlet me just explain
p2771
aVmost of her donor have done the same thing as i do
p2772
aVyou know what she should have done
p2773
aVand you know hillari what you should have done you should have chang the law when you were a unit state senat
p2774
aVbecaus your donor and your special interest are do the same thing as i do except even more so
p2775
aVwell you know
p2776
aVyou should have chang the law but you won t chang the law becaus you take in so much money i mean i sat in my apart today on a veri beauti hotel down the street known as trump
p2777
aVmade with chines steel
p2778
aVbut i will tell you i sat there
p2779
aVif you don t like what i did you should have chang the law
p2780
aVi will look at it at the time i m not look at anyth now i ll look at it at the time
p2781
aVwhat i ve seen what i ve seen is so bad first of all the media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pile on is so amaz the new york time actual wrote an articl about it but they don t even care it s so dishonest and they ve poison the mind of the voter
p2782
aVwell let me just tell you befor we go ani further in chicago which has the toughest gun law in the unit state probabl you could say by far they have more gun violenc than ani other citi so we have the toughest law and you have tremend gun violenc
p2783
aVbut unfortun for them i think the voter are see through it i think they re go to see through it we ll find out on novemb 8th but i think they re go to see through it
p2784
aVif you look excus me chris if you look at your voter roll you will see million of peopl that are regist to vote million this isn t come from me this is come from pew report and other place million of peopl that are regist to vote that shouldn t be regist to vote
p2785
aVso let me just give you one other thing so i talk about the corrupt media i talk about the million of peopl tell you one other thing she shouldn t be allow to run it s crook she s she s guilti of a veri veri serious crime she should not be allow to run
p2786
aVand just in that respect i say it s rig becaus she should never
p2787
aVchris she should never have been allow to run for the presid base on what she did with e mail and so mani other thing
p2788
aVwhat i m say is that i will tell you at the time i ll keep you in suspens ok
p2789
aVwell chris let me respond to that becaus that s horrifi you know everi time donald think thing are not go in his direct he claim whatev it is is rig against him
p2790
aVi am a veri strong support of the second amend and i am i don t know if hillari was say it in a sarcast manner but i m veri proud to have the endors of the nra and it s the earliest endors they ve ever given to anybodi who ran for presid so i m veri honor by all of that
p2791
aVthe fbi conduct a year long investig into my e mail they conclud there was no case he said the fbi was rig he lost the iowa caucus he lost the wisconsin primari he said the republican primari was rig against him then trump univers get su for fraud and racket he claim the court system and the feder judg is rig against him there was even a time when he didn t get an emmi for his tv program three year in a row and he start tweet that the emmi were rig against him
p2792
aVshould have gotten it
p2793
aVthis is this is a mindset this is how donald think and it s funni but it s also realli troubl
p2794
aVso that is not the way our democraci work we ve been around for 240 year we ve had free and fair elect we ve accept the outcom when we may not have like them and that is what must be expect of anyon stand on a debat stage dure a general elect you know presid obama said the other day when you re whine befor the game is even finish
p2795
aVit just show you re not up to do the job and let s you know let s be clear about what he is say and what that mean he is denigr he s talk down our democraci and i for one am appal that somebodi who is the nomine of one of our two major parti would take that kind of posit
p2796
aVi think what the fbi did and what the depart of justic did includ meet with her husband the attorney general in the back of an airplan on the tarmac in arizona i think it s disgrac i think it s a disgrac
p2797
aVi think we ve never had a situat so bad in this countri
p2798
aVwe are go to appoint justic this is the best way to help the second amend we are go to appoint justic that will feel veri strong about the second amend that will not do damag to the second amend
p2799
aVwell i am encourag that there is an effort led by the iraqi armi support by kurdish forc and also given the help and advic from the number of special forc and other american on the ground but i will not support put american soldier into iraq as an occupi forc i don t think that is in our interest and i don t think that would be smart to do in fact chris i think that would be a big red flag wave for isi to reconstitut itself
p2800
aVthe goal here is to take back mosul it s go to be a hard fight i ve got no illus about that and then continu to press into syria to begin to take back and move on raqqa which is the isi headquart
p2801
aVi am hope that the hard work that american militari advis have done will pay off and that we will see a real a realli success militari oper but we know we ve got lot of work to do syria will remain a hotb of terror as long as the civil war aid and abet by the iranian and the russian continu
p2802
aVso i have said look we need to keep our eye on isi that s whi i want to have an intellig surg that protect us here at home whi we have to go after them from the air on the ground onlin whi we have to make sure here at home we don t let terrorist buy weapon if you re too danger to fli you re too danger to buy a gun
p2803
aVand i m go to continu to push for a no fli zone and safe haven within syria not onli to help protect the syrian and prevent the constant outflow of refuge but to frank gain some leverag on both the syrian govern and the russian so that perhap we can have the kind of serious negoti necessari to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a polit track
p2804
aVlet me tell you mosul is so sad we had mosul but when she left when she took everybodi out we lost mosul now we re fight again to get mosul the problem with mosul and what they want to do is they want to get the leader of isi who they felt were in mosul
p2805
aVabout three month ago i start read that they want to get the leader and they re go to attack mosul whatev happen to the element of surpris ok we announc we re go after mosul i have been read about go after mosul now for about how long is it hillari three month these peopl have all left they ve all left
p2806
aVthe element of surpris dougla macarthur georg patton spin in their grave when they see the stupid of our countri so we re now fight for mosul that we had all she had to do was stay there and now we re go in to get it
p2807
aVbut you know who the big winner in mosul is go to be after we eventu get it and the onli reason they did it is becaus she s run for the offic of presid and they want to look tough they want to look good he violat the red line in the sand and he made so mani mistak made all the mistak that s whi we have the great migrat but she want to look good for the elect so they re go in
p2808
aVbut who s go to get mosul realli we ll take mosul eventu but the way if you look at what s happen much tougher than they thought much much tougher much more danger go to be more death that they thought
p2809
aVbut the leader that we want to get are all gone becaus they re smart they say what do we need this for so mosul is go to be a wonder thing and iran should write us a letter of thank you just like the realli stupid the stupidest deal of all time a deal that s go to give iran absolut nuclear weapon iran should write us yet anoth letter say thank you veri much becaus iran as i said mani year ago iran is take over iraq someth they ve want to do forev but we ve made it so easi for them
p2810
aVso we re now go to take mosul and do you know who s go to be the beneficiari iran oh yeah they re make i mean they are outsmart look you re not there you might be involv in that decis but you were there when you took everybodi out of mosul and out of iraq you shouldn t have been in iraq but you did vote for it you shouldn t have been in iraq but onc you were in iraq you should have never left the way
p2811
aVthe point is the big winner is go to be iran
p2812
aVwell you know onc again donald is impli that he didn t support the invas of iraq i said it was a mistak i ve said that year ago he has consist deni what is
p2813
aVwrong
p2814
aVright
p2815
aVa veri clear fact that
p2816
aVwrong
p2817
aVbefor the invas he support it and you know i just want everybodi to go googl it googl donald trump iraq and you will see the dozen of sourc which verifi that he was for the invas of iraq
p2818
aVwrong
p2819
aVand you can actual hear the audio of him say that now whi doe that matter well it matter becaus he has not told the truth about that posit i guess he believ it make him look better now to contrast with me becaus i did vote for it
p2820
aVbut what s realli import here is to understand all the interplay mosul is a sunni citi mosul is on the border of syria and yes we do need to go after baghdadi and just like we went after bin laden while you were do celebr apprentic and we brought him to justic we need to go after the leadership
p2821
aVbut we need to get rid of them get rid of their fighter there are an estim sever thousand fighter in mosul they ve been dig underground they ve been prepar to defend it s go to be tough fight but i think we can take back mosul and then we can move on into syria and take back raqqa
p2822
aVthis is what we have to do i m just amaz that he seem to think that the iraqi govern and our alli and everybodi els launch the attack on mosul to help me in this elect but that s how donald think you know he alway is look for some conspiraci
p2823
aVchris we don t gain anyth
p2824
aVhe has all the conspiraci theori
p2825
aViran is take over iraq
p2826
aViran is take over iraq we don t gain anyth
p2827
aVthis conspiraci theori which he s been spew out for quit some time
p2828
aVif they did it by surpris
p2829
aVhe say
p2830
aVwe could have gain if they did it by surpris
p2831
aVunfit and he prove it everi time he talk
p2832
aVwell if that would happen becaus i am pro life and i will be appoint pro life judg i would think that that will go back to the individu state
p2833
aVno you are the one that s unfit you know wikileak just actual came out john podesta said some horribl thing about you and boy was he right he said some beauti and you know berni sander he said you have bad judgment you do
p2834
aVand if you think that go into mosul after we let the world know we re go in and all of the peopl that we realli want the leader they re all gone if you think that was good then you do now john podesta said you have terribl instinct berni sander said you have bad judgment i agre with both
p2835
aVwell you should ask berni sander who he s support for presid and he has said
p2836
aVwhich is a big mistak
p2837
aVas he has campaign for me around the countri you are the most danger person to run for presid in the modern histori of america i think he s right
p2838
aVit s a catastroph i mean
p2839
aVit s a mess
p2840
aVhave you seen it have you seen it
p2841
aVhave you seen what s happen to aleppo
p2842
aVok so it hasn t fallen take a look at it
p2843
aVthat s right and they are be slaughter
p2844
aVbecaus of bad decis
p2845
aVif they overturn it it will go back to the state
p2846
aVwell aleppo is a disast it s a humanitarian nightmar but it has fallen from the from ani standpoint i mean what do you need a sign document take a look at aleppo it is so sad when you see what s happen
p2847
aVand a lot of this is becaus of hillari clinton becaus what s happen is by fight assad who turn out to be a lot tougher than she thought and now she s go to say oh he love assad she s he s just much tougher and much smarter than her and obama and everyon thought he was gone two year ago three year ago he he align with russia
p2848
aVhe now also align with iran who we made veri power we gave them 150 billion back we give them 1 7 billion in cash i mean cash bundl of cash as big as this stage we gave them 1 7 billion
p2849
aVnow they have he has align with russia and with iran they don t want isi but they have other thing becaus we re back we re back rebel we don t know who the rebel are we re give them lot of money lot of everyth we don t know who the rebel are and when and if and it s not go to happen becaus you have russia and you have iran now but if they ever did overthrow assad you might end up with as bad as assad is and he s a bad guy but you may veri well end up with wors than assad
p2850
aVif she did noth we d be in much better shape and this is what s caus the great migrat where she s take in ten of thousand of syrian refuge who probabl in mani case not probabl who are definit
p2851
aVin mani case isi align and we now have them in our countri and wait until you see this is go to be the great trojan hors and wait until you see what happen in the come year lot of luck hillari thank a lot for do a great job
p2852
aVwell chris first of all i think a no fli zone could save live and could hasten the end of the conflict i m well awar of the realli legitim concern that you have express from both the presid and the general
p2853
aVthis would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negoti and it would also take make it clear to the russian and the syrian that our purpos here was to provid safe zone on the ground
p2854
aVwe ve had million of peopl leav syria and those million of peopl insid syria who have been disloc so i think we could strike a deal and make it veri clear to the russian and the syrian that this was someth that we believ was in the best interest of the peopl on the ground in syria it would help us with our fight against isi
p2855
aVbut i want to respond to what donald said about refuge he s made these claim repeat i am not go to let anyon into this countri who is not vet who we do not have confid in but i am not go to slam the door on women and children that pictur of that littl 4 year old boy in aleppo with the blood come down his face while he sat in an ambul is haunt and so we are go to do veri care thorough vet that doe not solv our intern challeng with isi and our need to stop radic to work with american muslim communiti who are on the front line to identifi and prevent attack in fact the killer of the dozen of peopl at the nightclub in orlando the puls nightclub was born in queen the same place donald was born so let s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best go to be abl to meet it
p2856
aVand yes some of that threat eman from over in syria and iraq and we ve got to keep fight and i will defeat isi and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home
p2857
aVbut i just have to
p2858
aVit s so ridicul what she she will defeat isi we should have never let isi happen in the first place and right now they re in 32 countri
p2859
aVwe should have wait one second they had a ceas fire three week ago a ceas fire the unit state russia and syria and dure the ceas fire russia took over vast swatch of land and then they said we don t want the ceas fire anymor
p2860
aVwell if we put anoth two or perhap three justic on that s realli what s go to be that will happen and that ll happen automat in my opinion becaus i am put pro life justic on the court i will say this it will go back to the state and the state will then make a determin
p2861
aVwe are so outplay on missil on ceas fire they are outplay now she wasn t there i assum she had noth to do with it but our countri is so outplay by putin and assad and by the way and by iran nobodi can believ how stupid our leadership is
p2862
aVwell i say they re wrong becaus i m go to creat tremend job and we re bring gdp from realli 1 percent which is what it is now and if she got in it will be less than zero but we re bring it from 1 percent up to 4 percent and i actual think we can go higher than 4 percent i think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent and if we do you don t have to bother ask your question becaus we have a tremend machin we will have creat a tremend econom machin onc again to do that we re take back job we re not go to let our compani be raid by other countri where we lose all our job we don t make our product anymor it s veri sad but i m go to creat a the kind of a countri that we were from the standpoint of industri we use to be there we ve given it up we ve becom veri veri sloppi
p2863
aVwe ve had peopl that are polit hack make the biggest deal in the world bigger than compani you take these big compani these trade deal are far bigger than these compani and yet we don t use our great leader mani of whom back me and mani of whom back hillari i must say but we don t use those peopl those are the peopl these are the greatest negoti in the world we have the greatest businesspeopl in the world we have to use them to negoti our trade deal
p2864
aVwe use polit hack we use peopl that get the posit becaus they gave they made a campaign contribut and they re deal with china and peopl that are veri much smarter than they are so we have to use our great peopl
p2865
aVbut that be said we will creat an econom machin the like of which we haven t seen in mani decad and peopl chris will again go back to work and they ll make a lot of money and we ll have compani that will grow and expand and start from new
p2866
aVwell first when i hear donald talk like that and know that his slogan is make america great again i wonder when he thought america was great and befor he rush and say you know befor you and presid obama were there i think it s import to recogn that he has been critic our govern for decad
p2867
aVyou know back in 1987 he took out a 100 000 ad in the new york time dure the time when presid reagan was presid and basic said exact what he just said now that we were the laughingstock of the world he was critic presid reagan this is the way donald think about himself put himself into you know the middl and say you know i alon can fix it as he said on the convent stage
p2868
aVbut if you look at the debt which is the issu you ask about chris i pay for everyth i m propos i do not add a penni to the nation debt i take that veri serious becaus i do think it s one of the issu we ve got to come to grip with
p2869
aVso when i talk about how we re go to pay for educ how we re go to invest in infrastructur how we re go to get the cost of prescript drug down and a lot of the other issu that peopl talk to me about all the time i ve made it veri clear we are go where the money is we are go to ask the wealthi and corpor to pay their fair share
p2870
aVand there is no evid whatsoev that that will slow down or diminish our growth in fact i think just the opposit we ll have what economist call middl out growth we ve got to get back to rebuild the middl class the famili of america that s where growth will come from that s whi i want to invest in you i want to invest in your famili
p2871
aVand i think that s the smartest way to grow the economi to make the economi fairer and we just have a big disagr about this it may be becaus of our experi you know he start off with his dad as a millionair
p2872
aVyeah yeah we ve heard we ve heard this befor hillari
p2873
aVi start off with my dad was a small busi man
p2874
aVwe ve heard this befor
p2875
aVand i think it you know it s a differ that affect how we see the world and what we want to do with the economi
p2876
aVthank you hillari could i just respond
p2877
aVwell i strong support roe v wade which guarante a constitut right to a woman to make the most intim most difficult in mani case decis about her health care that one can imagin and in this case it s not onli about roe v wade it is about what s happen right now in america
p2878
aVbecaus i did disagre with ronald reagan veri strong on trade i disagre with him we should have been much tougher on trade even then i ve been wait for year nobodi doe it right
p2879
aVand frank now we re go to do it right
p2880
aVi m cut tax we re go to grow the economi it s go to grow at a record rate of growth
p2881
aVno it s go to total help you and one thing we have to do repeal and replac the disast known as obamacar it s destroy our countri it s destroy our busi our small busi and our big busi we have to repeal and replac obamacar
p2882
aVyou take a look at the kind of number that that will cost us in the year 17 it is a disast if we don t repeal and replac now it s probabl go to die of it own weight but obamacar has to go it s the premium are go up 60 percent 70 percent 80 percent next year they re go to go up over 100 percent
p2883
aVso mani state are put veri stringent regul on women that block them from exercis that choic to the extent that they are defund plan parenthood which of cours provid all kind of cancer screen and other benefit for women in our countri
p2884
aVand i m realli glad that the premium have start at least the peopl see what s happen becaus she want to keep obamacar and she want to make it even wors and it can t get ani wors bad health care at the most expens price we have to repeal and replac obamacar
p2885
aVwell chris i am on record as say that we need to put more money into the social secur trust fund that s part of my commit to rais tax on the wealthi my social secur payrol contribut will go up as will donald s assum he can t figur out how to get out of it but what we want to do is to replenish the social secur trust fund
p2886
aVsuch a nasti woman
p2887
aVby make sure that we have suffici resourc and that will come from either rais the cap and or find other way to get more money into it i will not cut benefit i want to enhanc benefit for low incom worker and for women who have been disadvantag by the current social secur system
p2888
aVbut what donald is propos with these massiv tax cut will result in a 20 trillion addit nation debt that will have dire consequ for social secur and medicar
p2889
aVand i ll say someth about the afford care act which he want to repeal the afford care act extend the solvenc of the medicar trust fund so if repeal it our medicar problem get wors what we need to do is go after
p2890
aVyour husband disagre with you
p2891
aVthe long term health care driver we ve got to get cost down increas valu emphas well i have a plan for do that and i think that we will be abl to get entitl spend under control by with more resourc and harder decis
p2892
aVdonald has said he s in favor of defund plan parenthood he even support shut the govern down to defund plan parenthood i will defend plan parenthood i will defend roe v wade and i will defend women s right to make their own health care decis
p2893
aVwell i would like to say to everyon watch tonight that i m reach out to all american democrat republican and independ becaus we need everybodi to help make our countri what it should be to grow the economi to make it fairer to make it work for everyon we need your talent your skill your commit your energi your ambit
p2894
aVyou know i ve been privileg to see the presid up close and i know the awesom respons of protect our countri and the incred opportun of work to tri to make life better for all of you i have made the caus of children and famili realli my life s work
p2895
aVthat s what my mission will be in the presid i will stand up for famili against power interest against corpor i will do everyth that i can to make sure that you have good job with rise incom that your kid have good educ from preschool through colleg i hope you will give me a chanc to serv as your presid
p2896
aVshe s rais the money from the peopl she want to control doesn t work that way
p2897
aVbut when i start this campaign i start it veri strong it s call make america great again we re go to make america great we have a deplet militari it has to be help has to be fix we have the greatest peopl on earth in our militari we don t take care of our veteran we take care of illeg immigr peopl that come into the countri illeg better than we take care of our vet that can t happen
p2898
aVour policemen and women are disrespect we need law and order but we need justic too our inner citi are a disast you get shot walk to the store they have no educ they have no job i will do more for african american and latino than she can ever do in 10 lifetim
p2899
aVall she s done is talk to the african american and to the latino but they get the vote and then they come back they say we ll see you in four year we are go to make america strong again and we are go to make america great again and it has to start now we cannot take four more year of barack obama and that s what you get when you get her
p2900
aVand we have come too far to have that turn back now and inde he said women should be punish that there should be some form of punish for women who obtain abort and i could just not be more oppos to that kind of think
p2901
aVbecaus roe v wade veri clear set out that there can be regul on abort so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account and when i vote as a senat i did not think that that was the case
p2902
aVthe kind of case that fall at the end of pregnanc are often the most heartbreak pain decis for famili to make i have met with women who toward the end of their pregnanc get the worst news one could get that their health is in jeopardi if they continu to carri to term or that someth terribl has happen or just been discov about the pregnanc i do not think the unit state govern should be step in and make those most person of decis so you can regul if you are do so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account
p2903
aVwell i think it s terribl if you go with what hillari is say in the ninth month you can take the babi and rip the babi out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the babi
p2904
aVnow you can say that that s ok and hillari can say that that s ok but it s not ok with me becaus base on what she s say and base on where she s go and where she s been you can take the babi and rip the babi out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day and that s not accept
p2905
aVwell that is not what happen in these case and use that kind of scare rhetor is just terribl unfortun you should meet with some of the women that i have met with women i have known over the cours of my life this is one of the worst possibl choic that ani woman and her famili has to make and i do not believ the govern should be make it
p2906
aVyou know i ve had the great honor of travel across the world on behalf of our countri i ve been to countri where govern either forc women to have abort like they use to do in china or forc women to bear children like they use to do in romania and i can tell you the govern has no busi in the decis that women make with their famili in accord with their faith with medic advic and i will stand up for that right
p2907
aVand honest nobodi has busi do what i just said do that as late as one or two or three or four day prior to birth nobodi has that
p2908
aVwell first of all she want to give amnesti which is a disast and veri unfair to all of the peopl that are wait on line for mani mani year we need strong border
p2909
aVin the audienc tonight we have four mother of i mean these are unbeliev peopl that i ve gotten to know over a period of year whose children have been kill brutal kill by peopl that came into the countri illeg you have thousand of mother and father and relat all over the countri they re come in illeg drug are pour in through the border we have no countri if we have no border
p2910
aVhillari want to give amnesti she want to have open border the border as you know the border patrol agent 16 500 plus ice last week endors me first time they ve ever endors a candid it mean their job is tougher but they know what s go on they know it better than anybodi they want strong border they feel we have to have strong border
p2911
aVi was up in new hampshir the other day the biggest complaint they have it s with all of the problem go on in the world mani of the problem caus by hillari clinton and by barack obama all of the problem the singl biggest problem is heroin that pour across our southern border it s just pour and destroy their youth it s poison the blood of their youth and plenti of other peopl we have to have strong border we have to keep the drug out of our countri we are right now we re get the drug they re get the cash we need strong border we need absolut we cannot give amnesti
p2912
aVnow i want to build the wall we need the wall and the border patrol ice they all want the wall we stop the drug we shore up the border one of my first act will be to get all of the drug lord all of the bad one we have some bad bad peopl in this countri that have to go out we re go to get them out we re go to secur the border and onc the border is secur at a later date we ll make a determin as to the rest but we have some bad hombr here and we re go to get them out
p2913
aVwell as he was talk i was think about a young girl i met here in las vega carla who is veri worri that her parent might be deport becaus she was born in this countri but they were not they work hard they do everyth they can to give her a good life
p2914
aVand you re right i don t want to rip famili apart i don t want to be send parent away from children i don t want to see the deport forc that donald has talk about in action in our countri
p2915
aVwe have 11 million undocu peopl they have 4 million american citizen children 15 million peopl he said as recent as a few week ago in phoenix that everi undocu person would be subject to deport now here s what that mean it mean you would have to have a massiv law enforc presenc where law enforc offic would be go school to school home to home busi to busi round up peopl who are undocu and we would then have to put them on train on buse to get them out of our countri
p2916

p2930
aVnow what i am also argu is that bring undocu immigr out from the shadow put them into the formal economi will be good becaus then employ can t exploit them and undercut american wage
p2931
aVand donald know a lot about this he use undocu labor to build the trump tower he underpaid undocu worker and when they complain he basic said what a lot of employ do you complain i ll get you deport

p2935
aVnow you can come back in and you can becom a citizen but it s veri unfair we have million of peopl that did it the right way they re on line they re wait we re go to speed up the process big leagu becaus it s veri ineffici but they re on line and they re wait to becom citizen
p2936
aVbush yes i take him for his word look i fulli recogn i m not of washington i m from texa and he s got a lot of experi but so do i and i ve been the chief execut offic of the second biggest state in the union i have a proud record of work with both republican and democrat which is what our nation need somebodi that can come to washington and say let s forget all the finger point and get posit thing done on medicar prescript drug social secur and so i take him for his word
p2937
aVbush we can make a huge differ by say if you receiv feder money we expect you to show result let me give you a stori about public educ if i might it s about kipp academi in houston texa a charter school run by some peopl from teach for america young folk say i m go to do someth good for my countri i want to teach a guy name michael run the school it is a school full of so call at risk children it s how wer unfortun label certain children basic it mean they can t learn it s a school of strong disciplin and high standard it s one of the best school in houston here are the key ingredi high expect strong accountabili what michael say don t put all these rule on us just let us teach and hold us account for everi grade that s what we do and as a result these main hispan youngster are some of the best learner in houston texa that s my vision for public educ all around america mani of you viewer don t know but laura and i sent our girl to public school they went to austin high school and mani of the public school are meet the call but unfortun a lot of school are trap children in school that just won t teach and won t chang here is the role of the feder govern one is to chang head start to a read program two is to say if you want to access read money you can do so the goal is for everi singl child to learn to read there must by k 2 diagnost teach tool avail we have to consolid the system to free the school and encourag innov let them reach out beyond the confin of the current structur to recruit teach for the children type teacher four we re go to say if you receiv feder money measur third fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth grade show us if they are learn to read write add and subtract there will be bonus plan if not instead of continu to subsid failur the money will go to the feder money will go to the parent for public school or charter school or tutori or cathol school what i care about is children and so doe michael feinberg and you know what it can happen in america with the right kind of leadership
p2938
aVgore we agre on a coupl of thing on educ i strong support new account so doe governor bush i strong support local control so doe governor bush i m in favor of test as a way of measur perform everi school and everi school district have everi state test the children i ve also propos a voluntari nation test in the fourth grade and eighth grade and a form of test the governor has not endors i think that all new teacher ought to be test includ in the subject that they teach we ve got to recruit 100 000 new teacher and i have budget for that we ve got to reduc the class size so that the student who walk in has more one on one time with the teacher we ought to have univers pre school and we ought to make colleg tuition tax deduct up to 10 000 a year i would like to tell you a quick stori i got a letter today as i left sarasota florida i m here with a group of 13 peopl from around the countri who help me prepar we had a great time two day ago we ate lunch at a restaur the guy that serv us lunch gave me a letter today his name is randi elli he has a 15 year old daughter name caley who is in sarasota high school her scienc class was suppos to be for 24 student she s the 36th student in that classroom they sent me a pictur of her in the classroom they can t squeez anoth desk in for her so she has to stand dure class i want the feder govern consist with local control and new account to make improv of our school the number one prioriti so caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn
p2939
aVbush the first is the differ is there is no new account measur in vice presid gore s plan he say he s for voluntari test you can t have voluntari test you must have mandatori test you must say that if you receiv money you must show us whether or not children are learn to read and write and add and subtract that s the differ you may claim you ve got mandatori test but you don t mr vice presid that s a huge differ test is the cornerston of reform you know how i know becaus it s the cornerston of reform in the state of texa republican and democrat came togeth and said what can we do to make our public educ the best in the countri we ve done a long way work togeth to do so the cornerston is to have strong account in return for money and in return for flexibl we re go to ask you to show us whether or not we ask you to post the result on the internet we encourag parent to take a look at the compar result of school we have a strong charter school movement that i sign the legisl to get start in the state of texa i believ if we find poor children trap in school that won t teach we need to free the parent we need to expand educ save account someth that my vice presidenti run mate support there s big differ he won t support free local district from the string of feder money
p2940
aVgore first of all i do have mandatori test i think the governor may not have heard what i said clear the voluntari nation test is in addit to the mandatori test that we requir of state all school all school district student themselv and requir teacher test which goe a step farther than governor bush has been will to go here are a coupl of differ though jim governor bush is in favor of voucher which take taxpay money away from public school and give them to privat school that are not account for how the money is use and don t have to take all applic now privat school play a great role in our societi all of our children have gone to both public school and privat school but i don t think privat school should have a right to take taxpay money away from public school at a time when caley elli is stand in that classroom let me give you anoth exampl i went to a school in dade counti florida where the facil are so overcrowd the children have to eat lunch in shift with the first shift for lunch start at 9 30 in the morn look this is a fund crisi all around the countri there are fewer parent of school age children as a percentag of the vote popul and there is the largest generat of student ever we re in an inform age when learn is more import than ever 90 of our kid go to public school we have to make it the number one prioriti modern our school reduc class size recruit new teacher give everi child a chanc to learn with one on one time in a qualiti high qualiti safe school if it s a fail school shut it down and reopen it under a new princip with a turnaround team of specialist the way governor jim hunt doe in north carolina here is anoth differ the governor if it s a fail school would leav the children in that fail school for three year and then give a littl bit of money to the parent a down payment on a down payment for privat school tuition and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a privat school it s an illus
p2941
aVbush okay first of all most of this is at the state level see here is the mental i m go to make the state do this and make the state do that all i m say is if you spend money show us result and test everi year which you do not do mr vice presid you don t test everi year you can say you do to the camera but you don t unless you ve chang your plan
p2942
aVgore i didn t say that
p2943
aVbush you need to test everi year that s whi you determin if children are progress to excel second one of the thing that we have to be care about in polit is throw money at a system that has not yet been reform more money is need and i spend more money but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leav no child behind stop this busi about ask gosh how old are you if you re 10 we ll put you here 12 you put here start ask the question what do you know if you don t know what you re suppos to know we ll make sure you do earli befor it s too late
p2944
aVgore jim if i could just respond i know that the governor use the phrase phoni number but if you look at the plan and add the number up these number are correct he spend more money for tax cut for the wealthiest 1 than all of his new spend propos for health care prescript drug educ and nation defens all combin i agre that the surplus is the american peopl s money it s your money that s whi i don t think we should give near half of it to the wealthiest 1 becaus the other 99 have had an aw lot to do with build the surplus in our prosper
p2945
aVgore when the action in kosovo was drag on and we were search for a solut to the problem our countri had defeat the adversari on the battlefield without a singl american life be lost in combat but the dictat milosev was hang on i invit the former prime minist of russia to my hous and took a risk in ask him to get person involv along with the head of finland to go to belgrad and to take a set of propos from the unit state that would constitut basic a surrend by serbia but it was a calcul risk that paid off now i could probabl give you some other exampl of decis over the last 24 year i have been in public servic for 24 year jim and throughout all that time the peopl i have fought for have been the middl class famili and i have been will to stand up to power interest like the big insur compani the drug compani the hmos the oil compani they have good peopl and they play construct role sometim but sometim they get too much power i cast my lot with the peopl even when it mean that you have to stand up to some power interest who are tri to turn the the polici and the law to their advantag you can see it in this campaign the big drug compani support governor bush s prescript drug propos they oppos mine becaus they don t want to get medicar involv becaus they re afraid that medicar will negoti lower price for senior who current pay the highest price of all
p2946
aVbush i ve been stand up to big busi hollywood big trial lawyer was the question about emerg wasn t it moder it was about okay
p2947
aVbush you know as governor one of the thing you have to deal with is catastroph i can rememb the fire that swept parker counti texa i rememb the flood that swept our state i rememb go down to del rio texa i have to pay the administr a compliment jame lee witt of fema has done a realli good job of work with governor dure time of crisi but that s the time when you re test not onli it s the time to test your metal a time to test your heart when you see peopl whose live have been turn upsid down it broke my heart to go to the flood scene in del rio where a fellow and his famili got complet uproot the onli thing i knew was to got aid as quick as possibl with state and feder help and to put my arm around the man and his famili and cri with them that s what governor do they are often on the front line of catastroph situat
p2948
aVbush well it depend obvious but what i would do first and foremost is i would get in touch with the feder reserv chairman allen greenspan to find out all the fact and all the circumst i would have my secretari of the treasuri be in touch with the financi center not onli here but at home i would make sure that key member of congress were call in to discuss the graviti of the situat and i would come up with a game plan to deal with it that s what governor end up do we end up be problem solver we come up with practic common sens solut for problem that we re confront with in this case in the case of a financi crisi i would gather all the fact befor i made the decis as to what the govern ought or ought not to do
p2949
aVgore first i want to compliment the governor on his respons to those fire and flood in texa i accompani jame lee witt down to texa when those fire broke out and fema has been a major flagship project of our reinvent govern effort and i agre it work extrem well now on the intern financi crise that come up my friend bob rubin the former secretari of treasuri is here he s a close advisor to me and great friend in all respect i have had a chanc to work with him and allen greenspan and other on the crisi follow the collaps of the mexican peso when the asian financi crisi rais the risk of world wide recess that could affect our economi and now of cours the euro s valu has been drop but seem to be under control but it start for me in the last eight year when i had the honor of cast the tie break vote to end the old econom plan here at home and put into place a new econom plan that has help us to make some progress 22 million new job the greatest prosper ever but it s not good enough my attitud is you ain t seen noth yet we need to do more and better
p2950
aVbush no there s no differ on that there is a differ though as to what the economi has meant i think the economi has meant more for the gore and clinton folk than the gore and clinton folk have meant for the economi i think most of the econom growth that has taken place is a result of ingenu and hard work and entrepreneurship and that s the role of gover to encourag that in term of in respons to the question no
p2951
aVgore can i comment on that
p2952
aVgore you know i think the american peopl deserv credit for the great economi that we have it s their ingenu i agre with that but you know they were work pretti hard eight year ago and now they had ingenu eight year ago the differ is we ve got a new polici and instead of concentr on tax cut most for the wealthi we want i want tax cut for the middl class famili and i want to continu the prosper and make sure that it enrich not just a few but all of our famili we have gone from the biggest deficit to the biggest surplus we have gone from a tripl debt recess dure the previous 12 year to a tripl in the stock market instead of a high unemploy we have the lowest african american and latin american unemploy rate in histori and 22 million new job it s not good enough too mani peopl have been left behind we have got to do much more the key is job train educ invest in health care and educ environ retir secur and incident we have got to preserv social secur i m oppos to divert one out of everi six dollar out of the social secur trust fund as the governor has propos into the stock market i want new incent for save and invest for the young coupl who are work hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of social secur not at the expens of social secur as the governor propos
p2953
aVbush two point one a lot of folk are still wait for that 1992 middl class tax cut i rememb the vice presid say just give us a chanc to get up there we re go to make sure you get tax cut it didn t happen now he s have to say that again they ve had their chanc to deliv a tax cut to you second the surest way to bust this economi is to increas the role and size of the feder budget the senat budget committe did a studi of the vice presid s expenditur it s been project that they could conceiv bust the budget by 900 billion that mean he ll either have to rais your tax by 900 billion or go into the social secur surplus for 900 billion this is a plan that is go to increas the bureaucraci by 20 000 peopl his target tax cut is so detail so much fine print that it is go to requir numer ir agent we need somebodi to simplifi the code to be fair to continu prosper by share some of the surplus with the peopl who pay the bill particular those at the bottom end of the econom ladder
p2954
aVgore if i could respond jim what he s quot is not the senat budget commiitt it is a partisan press releas by the republican on the senat budget committe that s not worth the govern the taxpay paid paper that it s print on now as for 20 000 new bureaucrat as you call them you know the size of the feder govern will go down in a gore administr in the reinvent govern program you just look at the number it is 300 000 peopl smaller today than it was eight year ago now the fact is you re go to have a hard time convinc folk that we were a whole lot better off eight year ago than we are today but that s not the question the question is will we be better off four year from now than we are today and as for the surest way to threaten our prosper have a 1 9 trillion tax cut almost half of which goe to the wealthi and a 1 trillion social secur privat propos is the surest way to put our budget into deficit
p2955
aVbush i can t let the man continu with fuzzi math it is 1 3 trillion it will go to everybodi who pay tax i m not go to be the kind of presid that say you get tax relief and you don t i m not go to be a picker and chooser what is fair is everybodi who pay tax ought to get relief
p2956
aVgore suit me
p2957
aVbush actual what i ve said jim i ve said that eight year ago they campaign on prescript drug for senior and four year ago they campaign on get prescript drug for senior and now they re campaign on get prescript drug for senior it seem like they can t get it done now they may blame other folk but it s time to get somebodi in washington who is go to work with both republican and democrat to get some posit thing done when it come to our senior and so what i ve said is that there s been some miss opportun they ve had a chanc they ve had a chanc to form consensus i ve go a plan on medicar for exampl that s a two stage plan that say we ll have immedi help for senior and what i call immedi help hand a 48 billion program but i also want to say to senior if you re happi with medicar the way it is fine you can stay in the program but we re go to give you addit choic like they give feder employe in the feder employe health plan they have a varieti of choic to choos so should senior and my point has been as oppos to politic an issu like medicar in other word hold it up hope somebodi bite it and tri to clobber them over the head for polit purpos this year it s time to get it done onc and for all that s what i ve been critic about the administr for same with social secur i think there was a good opportun to bring republican and democrat togeth to reform the social secur system so senior will never go without those on social secur today will have their promis made but also to give younger worker the option at their choic of be abl to manag some of their own money in the privat sector to make sure there s a social secur system around tomorrow there are a lot of young worker at our ralli we go to that when they hear i ll trust them at their option to be abl to manag under certain guidelin some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they ll have a retir plan in the futur they begin to nod their head and they want a differ attitud in washington
p2958
aVgore i do disagre becaus if we can keep our prosper go if we can continu balanc the budget and pay down the debt then the strong economi keep generat surplus here is my plan i will keep social secur in a lockbox and that pay down the nation debt and the interest save i would put right back into social secur that extend the life of social secur for 55 year now i think that it s veri import to understand that cut benefit under social secur mean that peopl like winifr skinner from des moin iowa who is here would realli have a much harder time becaus there are million of senior who are live almost hand to mouth and you talk about cut benefit i don t go along with it i am oppos to it i m also oppos to a plan that divert 1 out of everi 6 away from the social secur trust fund social secur is a trust fund that pay the check this year with the money that is paid into social secur this year the governor want to divert 1 out of everi 6 off into the stock market which mean that he would drain a trillion dollar out of the social secur trust fund in this generat over the next ten year and social secur under that approach would go bankrupt within this generat his lead advisor on this plan actual said that would be okay becaus then the social secur trust fund could start borrow it would borrow up to 3 trillion now social secur has never done that and i don t think it should do that i think it should stay in a lockbox and i ll tell you this i will veto anyth that take money out of social secur for privat or anyth els other than social secur
p2959
aVbush i thought it was interest that on the two minut he spent about a million and a half on my plan which mean he doesn t want you to know what he s do is load up ious for futur generat he put no real asset into the social secur system the revenu exceed the expens in social secur until the year 2015 which mean all retire are go to get the promis made for those of you who he want to scare into the vote booth to vote for him hear me loud and clear a promis made will be a promis kept you bet we want to allow younger worker to take some of their own money that s the differ of opinion the vice presid think it s the govern s money the payrol tax are your money you ought to put it in prudent safe invest so that 1 trillion over the next ten year grow to be 3 trillion the money stay within the social secur system it s a part of the social secur system he claim it will be out of social secur it s your money it s a part of your retir benefit it s a fundament differ between what we believ i want you to have your own asset that you can call your own that you can pass on from one generat to the next i want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltri 2 that the current social secur trust get today mr greenspan i thought miss an opportun to say there s a third way and that is to get a better rate of return on the social secur moni come into the trust there is 2 3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger worker have a social secur plan in the futur if we re smart and if we trust worker and if we understand the power of the compound rate of interest
p2960
aVgore here is the differ i give a new incent for younger worker to save their own money and invest their own money but not at the expens of social secur on top of social secur my plan is social secur plus the governor s plan is social secur minus your futur benefit would be cut by the amount that s divert into the stock market if you make bad invest that s too bad but even befor then the problem hit becaus the money contribut to social secur this year is an entitl that s how it work and the money is use to pay the benefit for senior this year if you cut the amount go in 1 out of everi 6 then you have to cut the valu of each check by 1 out of everi 6 unless you come up with the money from somewher els i would like to know from the governor i know we re not suppos to ask each other question but i d be interest in know doe that trillion dollar come from the trust fund or doe it come from the rest of the budget
p2961
aVbush no there s enough money to pay senior today in the current affair of social secur the trillion come from the surplus surplus is money more money than need let me tell you what your plan is it s not social secur plus it s social secur plus huge debt that is what it is you leav futur generat with tremend ious it s time to have a leader that doesn t put off tomorrow what we should do today it s time to have somebodi to step up and say look let s let younger worker take some of their own money and under certain guidelin invest it in the privat market the safest of feder invest yield 4 that s twice the amount of rate of return than the current social secur trust it s a fundament differ of opinion here folk younger worker after younger worker hear my call that say i trust you and you know what the issu is chang senior now understand that the promis made will be a promis kept but younger worker now understand we better have a govern that trust them and that s exact what i m go to do
p2962
aVgore could i respond to that jim this is a big issu could we do anoth round on it
p2963
aVgore just briefli when fdr establish social secur they didn t call them ious they call it the full faith and credit of the unit state if you don t have trust in that i do if you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund that mean the trust fund goe bankrupt in this generat within 20 year
p2964
aVbush this is a govern that think a 2 rate of return on your money is satisfactori it s not this is a govern that say younger worker can t possibl have their own asset we need to think differ about the issu we need to make sure our senior get the promis made if we don t trust younger worker to manag some of their own money with the social secur surplus to grow from 1 trillion to 3 trillion it will be imposs to bridg the gap without it what mr gore s plan will do caus huge payrol tax or major benefit reduct
p2965
aVbush the man love his wife and i appreci that a lot and i love mine the man love his famili a lot and i appreci that becaus i love my famili i think the thing that discourag me about the vice presid was utter those famous word no control legal author i felt like there need to be a better sens of respons of what was go on in the white hous i believ that i believ they ve move that sign the buck stop here from the oval offic desk to the buck stop here on the lincoln bedroom it s not good for the countri and it s not right we need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselv in offic there s a huge trust i see it all the time when peopl come up to me and say i don t want you to let me down again and we can do better than the past administr has done it s time for a fresh start it s time for a new look it s time for a fresh start after a season of cynic and so i don t know the man well but i ve been disappoint about how he and his administr have conduct the fundrais affair you know go to a buddhist templ and then claim it wasn t a fundrais isn t my view of respons
p2966
aVgore i think we ought to attack our countri s problem not attack each other i want to spend my time make this countri even better than it is not tri to make you out to be a bad person you may want to focus on scandal i want to focus on result as i said a coupl of month ago i stand here as my own man and i want you to see me for who i realli am tipper and i have been marri for 30 year we becam grandpar a year and a half ago we ve got four children i have devot 24 year of my life to public servic and i ve said this befor and i ll say it again if you entrust me with the presid i may not be the most excit politician but i will work hard for you everi day i will fight for middl class famili and work men and women and i will never let you down
p2967
aVbush they ought to factor in it when they go to the vote booth
p2968
aVbush i think peopl need to be held respons for the action they take in life i think that well i think that s part of the need for a cultur chang we need to say we each need to be respons for what we do peopl in the highest offic of the land must be respons for decis they make in life and that s the way i ve conduct myself as governor of texa and that s the way i ll conduct myself as presid of the unit state should i be fortun enough to earn your vote
p2969
aVgore no i think the american peopl should take into account who we are as individu what our experi is what our posit are on the issu and propos are i m ask you to see me for who i realli am i m offer you my own vision my own experi my own propos and incident one of them is this this current campaign financ system has not reflect credit on anybodi in either parti and that s one of the reason i ve said befor and i ll pledg here tonight if i m presid the veri first bill that joe lieberman and i will send to the unit state congress is the mccain feingold campaign financ reform bill and the reason it s that import is that all of the other issu whether prescript drug for all senior that are oppos by the drug compani or the patient s bill of right to take the decis away from the hmos and give them to the doctor and nurs oppos by the hmos and insur compani all these other propos are go to be a lot easier to get pass for the american peopl if we limit the influenc of special interest money and give democraci back to the american peopl and i wish governor bush would join me this even in endors the mccain feingold campaign financ reform bill
p2970
aVbush you know this man has no credibl on the issu as a matter of fact i read in the new york time where he said he co sponsor the mccain feingold campaign fundrais bill but he wasn t in the senat with senat feingold and so look i m go to what you need to know about me is i will uphold the law i m go to have an attorney general that enforc the law the time for campaign fund reform is after the elect this man has outspent me and the special interest are outspend me and i am not go to lay down my arm in the middl of the campaign for somebodi who has got no credibl on the issu
p2971

p2977
aVbush i guess my answer to that is the man is run on medi scare tri to frighten peopl into the vote booth it s not what i think and it s not my intent and not my plan i want all senior to have prescript drug in medicar we need to reform medicar this administr has fail to do it senior will have not onli a medicar plan where the poor senior will have prescript drug paid for but there will be a varieti of option the current system today has meant a lot for a lot of senior and i realli appreci the intent of the current system if you re happi with the system you can stay in it there are a lot of procedur that haven t kept up in medicar with the current time no prescript drug benefit no drug therapi no prevent medicin no vision care we need to have a modern system to help senior and the idea of support a feder control 132 000 page document bureaucraci as be a compassion way for senior and the onli compassion sourc of care for senior is not my vision we ought to give senior more option i believ we ought to make the system work better i know this i know it will requir a differ kind of leader to go to washington to say to both republican and democrat let s come togeth you ve had your chanc vice presid you ve been there for eight year and noth has been done my point is is that my plan not onli trust senior with option my plan set asid 3 4 trillion for medicar over the next ten year my plan also say it requir a new approach in washington d c it s go to requir somebodi who can work across the partisan divid
p2978
aVgore if i could respond to that under my plan i will put medicar in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from be use for anyth other than medicar the governor has declin to endors that idea even though the republican as well as democrat leader in congress have endors it i would be interest to see if he would say this even he ll put medicar in a lockbox 100 billion come out of medicar just for the wealthiest 1 in the tax cut now here is the differ some peopl who say the word reform actual mean cut under the governor s plan if you kept the same fee for servic that you have now under medicar your premium would go up by between 18 and 47 and that is the studi of the congression plan that he s model his propos on by the medicar actuari let me give you one quick exampl there is a man here tonight name georg mckinney from milwauke he s 70 year old has high blood pressur his wife has heart troubl they have an incom of 25 000 a year they can t pay for their prescript drug they re some of the one that go to canada regular in order to get their prescript drug under my plan half of their cost would be paid right away under governor bush s plan they would get not one penni for four to five year and then they would be forc to go into an hmo or to an insur compani and ask them for coverag but there would be no limit on the premium or the deduct or ani of the term and condit
p2979
aVbush i cannot let this go by the old style washington polit if we re go to scare you in the vote booth under my plan the man get immedi help with prescript drug it s call immedi help hand instead of squabbl and finger point he get immedi help let me say someth
p2980
aVgore well jim first of all i would like to thank the sponsor of this debat and the peopl of boston for host the debat i would like to thank governor bush for particip and i would like to say i m happi to be here with tipper and our famili i have actual not question governor bush s experi i have question his propos and here is whi i think this is a veri import moment for our countri we have achiev extraordinari prosper and in this elect america has to make an import choic will we use our prosper to enrich not just the few but all of our famili i believ we have to make the right and respons choic if i m entrust with the presid here are the choic that i will make i will balanc the budget everi year i will pay down the nation debt i will put medicar and social secur in a lockbox and protect them and i will cut tax for middl class famili i believ it s import to resist the temptat to squander our surplus if we make the right choic we can have a prosper that endur and enrich all of our peopl if i m entrust with the presid i will help parent and strengthen famili becaus you know if we have prosper that grow and grow we still won t be success unless we strengthen famili by for exampl ensur that children can alway go to school that are safe by give parent the tool to protect their children against cultur pollut i will make sure that we invest in our countri and our famili and i mean invest in educ health care the environ and middl class tax cut and retir secur that is my agenda and that is whi i think that it s not just a question of experi
p2981
aVgore they get 25 000 a year incom that make them inelig
p2982
aVbush look this is a man who has great number he talk about number i m begin to think not onli did he invent the internet but he invent the calcul it s fuzzi math it s a scare he s tri to scare peopl in the vote booth under my tax plan that he continu to critic i set one third the feder govern should take no more than a third of anybodi s check but i also drop the bottom rate from 15 to 10 becaus by far the vast major of the help goe to peopl at the bottom end of the econom ladder if you re a famili of four in massachusett make 50 000 you get a 50 cut in the feder incom tax you pay it s from 4000 to about 2000 now the differ in our plan is i want that 2 000 to go to you and the vice presid would like to be spend the 2 000 on your behalf
p2983
aVgore it s just clear you can go to the websit and look if you make more than 25 000 a year you don t get a penni of help under the bush prescript drug propos for at least four to five year and then you re push into a medicar into an hmo or insur compani plan and there s no limit on the premium or the deduct or ani of the condit and the insur compani say it won t work and they won t offer these plan
p2984
aVgore correct
p2985
aVbush correct
p2986
aVgore the differ is i want to bring it to 100 and he want to bring it to 5
p2987
aVbush that s total fals for him to stand up here and say that let me make sure the senior hear me loud and clear they have had their chanc to get someth done i m go to work with democrat and republican to reform the system all senior will be cover all senior will have their prescript drug paid for and in the meantim we ll have a plan to help poor senior and in the meantim it could be one year or two year
p2988
aVgore let me call your attent to the key word there he said all poor senior
p2989
aVbush wait a minut all senior are cover under prescript drug in my plan
p2990
aVgore in the first year
p2991
aVbush if we can get it done in the first year you bet
p2992
aVgore it s a two phase plan for the first four year it take a year to pass it and for the first four year onli the poor are cover middl class senior like georg mckinney and his wife are not cover for four to five year
p2993
aVgore excel question and here is the simpl differ my plan has not onli a short term compon but also a long term compon and it focus not onli on increas the suppli which i think we have to do but also on work on the consumpt side now in the short term we have to free ourselv from the domin of the big oil compani that have the abil to manipul the price from opec when they want to rais the price and in the long term we have to give new incent for the develop of domest resourc like deep gas in the western gulf like stripper well for oil but also renew sourc of energi and domest sourc that are cleaner and better and i m propos a plan that will give tax credit and tax incent for the rapid develop of new kind of car and truck and buse and factori and boiler and furnac that don t have as much pollut that don t burn as much energi and that help us get out on the cut edg of the new technolog that will creat million of new job becaus when we sell these new product here we ll then be abl to sell them oversea there is a raven demand for them oversea now anoth big differ is governor bush is propos to open up some of our most precious environment treasur like the arctic nation wildlif refug for the big oil compani to go in and start produc oil there i think that is the wrong choic it would onli give us a few month worth of oil and the oil wouldn t start flow for mani year into the futur i don t think it s a fair price to pay to destroy precious part of america s environ we have to bet on the futur and move beyond the current technolog to have a whole new generat of more effici cleaner energi technolog
p2994
aVbush it s an issu i know a lot about i was a small oil person for a while in west texa this is an administr that s had no plan and all of a sudden the result of have no plan have caught up with america first and foremost we have to fulli fund heat which is a way to help low incom peopl in the east to pay for high fuel bill we need an activ explor incent in america we need to explor at home you bet i want to open up a small part of alaska when that field is onlin it will produc one million barrel a day today we import one million barrel from saddam hussein i would rather that a million come from our own hemispher have it come from our own countri as oppos to saddam hussein i want to develop the coal resourc in america have clean coal technolog we better start explor it or otherwis we ll be in deep troubl in the futur becaus of our depend upon foreign sourc of crude
p2995
aVgore let me clarifi i m for do someth both on the suppli side and product side and on the consumpt side let me say that i found one thing in governor bush s answer that we certain agre on and that s the low incom heat assist program i commend you for support that i work to get 400 million just a coupl of week ago and to establish a perman home heat oil reserv here in the northeast now as for the propos that i ve work for for renew and conserv and effici and new technolog for the last few year in the congress we ve face a lot of opposit to them they ve onli approv about 10 of the agenda i ve help to send up there we need to get serious about this energi crisi both in the congress and in the white hous and if you entrust me with the presid i will tackl this problem and focus on new technolog that will make us less depend on big oil or foreign oil
p2996
aVbush well we do come from differ place i come from be a west texa the governor is the chief execut offic we know how to set agenda as a governor i think you ll find the differ reflect in our budget i want to take one half of the surplus and dedic it to social secur one quarter of the surplus for import project and i want to send one quarter of the surplus back to the peopl who pay the bill i want everybodi who pay tax to have their tax rate cut and that stand in contrast to my worthi oppon s plan which will increas the size of govern dramat his plan is three time larger than presid clinton s propos plan eight year ago it is a plan that will have 200 new program expand program and creat 20 000 new bureaucrat it it empow washington my vision is to empow american to be abl to make decis for themselv in their own live
p2997
aVbush well i would first say he should have been tackl it for the last seven year the differ is we need to explor at home and the vice presid doesn t believ in explor for exampl in alaska there s a lot of shut in gas that we need to be move out of alaska by pipelin there s an interest issu up in the northwest as well do we remov dam that produc hydroelectr energi i m against remov dam in the northwest we need to keep that in line i was in coal countri in west virginia there is an abund suppli of coal in this countri i know we can do a better job of clean coal technolog i m go to ask the congress for 2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technolog in the world in the short term we need to get after it here in america we need to explor our resourc and we need to develop our reservoir of domest product we also need to have a hemispher energi polici where canada mexico and the unit state come togeth i brought this up recent with the newli elect presid in mexico he s a man i know from mexico i talk to him about how best to expedit the explor of natur gas in mexico and transport it up to the unit state so we becom less depend on foreign sourc of crude oil it s a major problem face america the administr did not deal with it it s time for a new administr to deal with the energi problem
p2998
aVgore i found a coupl of other thing we agre upon we may not find that mani this even so i want to emphas i strong support new invest in clean coal technolog i made a propos three month ago on this and also domest explor yes but not in the environment treasur of our countri we don t have to do that that s the wrong choic i know the oil compani have been itch to do that but it is not the right thing to do
p2999
aVbush it s the right thing for the consum less depend upon foreign sourc of crude is good for consum and we can do so in an environment friend way
p3000
aVbush i don t think a presid can do that i was disappoint in the rule becaus i think abort ought to be more rare in america and i m worri that that pill will creat more abort and caus more peopl to have abort this is a veri import topic and it s a veri sensit topic becaus a lot of good peopl disagre on the issu i think what the next presid ought to do is to promot a cultur of life in america life of the elder and life of those women all across the countri life of the unborn as a matter of fact i think a nobl goal for this countri is that everi child born or unborn need to be protect by law and welcom to life i know we need to chang a lot of mind befor we get there in america what i do believ is that we can find good common ground on issu of parent consent or parent notif i know we need to ban partial birth abort this is a place where my oppon and i have strong disagr i believ ban partial birth abort would be a posit step to reduc the number of abort in america it is an issu that will requir a new attitud we ve been battl over abort for a long period of time sure this nation can come togeth to promot the valu of life sure we can fight off these law that will encourag doctor to to allow doctor to take the live of our senior sure we can work togeth to creat a cultur life so some of these youngster who feel like they can take a neighbor s life with a gun will understand that that s not the way america is meant to be sure we can find common ground to reduc the number of abort in america as to the drug itself i mention i was disappoint i hope the fda took it time to make sure that american women will be safe who use this drug
p3001
aVgore well jim the fda took 12 year and i do support that decis they determin it was medic safe for the women who use that drug this is inde a veri import issu first of all on the issu of partial birth or so call late term abort i would sign a law ban that procedur provid that doctor have the abil to save a woman s life or to act if her health is sever at risk that s not the main issu the main issu is whether or not the roe v wade decis is go to be overturn i support a woman s right to choos my oppon doe not it is import becaus the next presid is go to appoint three and mayb even four justic of the suprem court and governor bush has declar to the anti choic group that he will appoint justic in the mold of scalia and clarenc thoma who are known for be the most vigor oppon of a woman s right to choos here is the differ he trust the govern to order a woman to do what it think she ought to do i trust women to make the decis that affect their live their destini and their bodi and i think a woman s right to choos ought to be protect and defend
p3002
aVbush i don t think a presid can unilater overturn it the fda has made it decis
p3003
aVbush i think onc a decis has been made it s been made unless it s proven to be unsaf to women
p3004
aVgore jim the question you ask if i heard you correct was would he support legisl to overturn it and if i heard the statement day befor yesterday you said you would order he said he would order his fda appointe to review the decis now that sound to me a littl bit differ i just think that we ought to support the decis
p3005
aVbush i said i would make sure that women would be safe who use the drug
p3006
aVbush i am pro life
p3007
aVbush the voter should assum i have no litmus test on that issu or ani other issu voter will know i ll put compet judg on the bench peopl who will strict interpret the constitut and not use the bench for write social polici that is go to be a big differ between my oppon and me i believ that the judg ought not to take the place of the legisl branch of govern that they re appoint for life and that they ought to look at the constitut as sacr they shouldn t misus their bench i don t believ in liber activist judg i believ in strict constructionist those are the kind of judg i will appoint i ve name four in the state of texa and ask the peopl to check out their qualif their deliber they re good solid men and women who have made good sound judgment on behalf of the peopl of texa
p3008
aVgore we both use similar languag to reach an exact opposit outcom i don t favor a litmus test but i know that there are way to assess how a potenti justic interpret the constitut and in my view the constitut ought to be interpret as a document that grow with our countri and our histori and i believ for exampl that there is a right of privaci in the fourth amend and when the phrase a strict constructionist is use and when the name of scalia and thoma are use as the benchmark for who would be appoint those are code word and nobodi should mistak this for say the governor would appoint peopl who would overturn roe v wade it s veri clear to me i would appoint peopl that have a philosophi that i think will be quit like would uphold roe v wade
p3009
aVgore yes jim i said that his tax cut plan for exampl rais the question of whether it s the right choic for the countri and let me give you an exampl of what i mean under governor bush s tax cut propos he would spend more money on tax cut for the wealthiest 1 than all of the new spend that he propos for educ health care prescript drug and nation defens all combin now i think those are the wrong prioriti now under my propos for everi dollar that i propos in spend for thing like educ and health care i will put anoth dollar into middl class tax cut and for everi dollar that i spend in those two categori i ll put 2 toward pay down the nation debt i think it s veri import to keep the debt go down and complet elimin it and i also think it s veri import to go to the next stage of welfar reform our countri has cut the welfar roll in half i fought hard from my day in the senat and as vice presid to cut the welfar roll and we ve move million of peopl in america into good job but it s now time for the next stage of welfar reform and includ father and not onli mother
p3010
aVbush it sound like he s not veri right tonight i just told you the criteria on which i ll appoint judg i have a record of appoint judg in the state of texa that s what a governor get to do a governor get to name suprem court judg he also read all kind of thing into my tax plan and into my medicar plan i want the viewer out there to listen to what i have to say about it
p3011
aVgore it would be like that they would uphold roe v wade i do believ it s wrong to use a litmus test if you look at the histori of a lower court judg s rule you can get a pretti good idea of how they ll interpret question a lot of question are first impress and these question that have been seen mani time come up in a new context and so but you know this is a veri import issu becaus a lot of young women in this countri take this right for grant and it could be lost it is on the ballot in this elect make no mistak about it
p3012
aVbush i ll tell you what kind of judg he ll put on he ll put liber activist justic who will use their bench to subvert the legislatur that s what he ll do
p3013
aVgore well milosev has lost the elect his oppon kostunica has won the elect it s overwhelm milosev s govern refus to releas the vote count there s now a general strike go on they re demonstr i think we should support the peopl of serbia and yugoslavia as they call the serbia plus montenegro and put pressur in everi way possibl to recogn the law outcom of the elect the peopl of serbia have act veri brave in kick this guy out of offic now he is tri to not releas the vote and then go straight to a so call runoff elect without even announc the result of the first vote now we ve made it clear along with our alli that when milosev leav then serbia will be abl to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world that is a veri strong incent that we ve given them to do the right thing bear in mind also milosev has been indict as a war crimin and he should be held account for his action now we have to take measur step becaus the sentiment within serbia is for understand reason against the unit state becaus their nation even if they don t like milosev they still have some feel linger from the nato action there so we have to be intellig in the way we go about it but make no mistak about it we should do everyth we can to see that the will of the serbian peopl express in this extraordinari elect is done and i hope that he ll be out of offic veri short
p3014
aVbush well i m pleas with the result of the elect as the vice presid said it s time for the man to go it mean that the unit state must have a strong diplomat hand with our friend in nato that s whi it s import to make sure our allianc are as strong as they possibl can be to keep the pressur on mr milosev but this will be an interest moment for the russian to step up and lead as well be a wonder time for the russian to step into the balkan and convinc mr milosev that it s in his best interest and his countri s best interest the russian have sway in that part of the world we would like to see the russian use that sway to encourag democraci to take hold it s an encourag elect it s time for the man to leav
p3015
aVgore in this particular situat no bear in mind that we have a lot of sanction in forc against serbia right now and the peopl of serbia know that they can escap all those sanction if this guy is turn out of power now i understand what the governor has said about ask the russian to be involv and under some circumst that might be a good idea but be as they have not yet been will to recogn kostunica as the law winner of the elect i m not sure it s right for us to invit the presid of russia to mediat this this disput there becaus we might not like the result that come out of that they current favor go forward with a runoff elect i think that s the wrong thing i think the governor s instinct is not necessarili bad becaus we have work with the russian in a construct way in kosovo for exampl to end the conflict there but i think we need to be veri care in the present situat befor we invit the russian to play the lead role in mediat
p3016
aVbush well obvious we wouldn t use the russian if they didn t agre with our answer mr vice presid let me say this to you i wouldn t use forc i wouldn t use forc
p3017
aVbush no
p3018
aVbush it s not in our nation interest to use forc i would use pressur and diplomaci there is a differ what the presid did in kosovo and this it s up to the peopl in this region to take control of their countri
p3019
aVbush well if it s in our vital nation interest and that mean whether our territori is threaten or peopl could be harm whether or not the allianc are our defens allianc are threaten whether or not our friend in the middl east are threaten that would be a time to serious consid the use of forc second whether or not the mission was clear whether or not it was a clear understand as to what the mission would be third whether or not we were prepar and train to win whether or not our forc were of high moral and high stand and well equip and final whether or not there was an exit strategi i would take the use of forc veri serious i would be guard in my approach i don t think we can be all thing to all peopl in the world i think we ve got to be veri care when we commit our troop the vice presid and i have a disagr about the use of troop he believ in nation build i would be veri care about use our troop as nation builder i believ the role of the militari is to fight and win war and therefor prevent war from happen in the first place so i would take my respons serious and it start with make sure we rebuild our militari power moral in today s militari is too low we re have troubl meet recruit goal we met the goal this year but in the previous year we have not met recruit goal some of our troop are not well equip i believ we re overextend in too mani place and therefor i want to rebuild the militari power it start with a billion dollar pay rais for the men and women who wear the uniform a billion dollar more than the presid recent sign into law it s to make sure our troop are well hous and well equip bonus plan to keep some of our high skill folk in the servic and a command in chief that set the mission to fight and win war and prevent war from happen in the first place
p3020
aVgore i want to make it clear our militari is the strongest best train best equip best led fight forc in the world and in the histori of the world nobodi should have ani doubt about that least of all our adversari or potenti adversari if you entrust me with the presid i will do whatev is necessari in order to make sure our forc stay the strongest in the world in fact in my ten year budget propos i ve set asid more than twice as much for this purpos as governor bush has in his propos now i think we should be reluct to get involv in someplac in a foreign countri but if our nation secur is at stake if we have alli if we ve tri everi other cours if we re sure militari action will succeed and if the cost are proportion to the benefit we should get involv now just becaus we don t want to get involv everywher doesn t mean we should back off anywher it come up i disagre with the propos that mayb onli when oil suppli are at stake that our nation secur is at risk i think that there are situat like in bosnia or kosovo where there s a genocid where our nation secur is at stake there

aVbush i agre our militari is the strongest in the world today that s not the question the question is will it be the strongest in the year to come everywher i go on the campaign trail i see mom and dad whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discourag their son or daughter may be a recent poll was taken among 1 000 enlist personnel as well as offic over half of whom will leav the servic when their time of enlist is up the captain are leav the servic there is a problem and it s go to requir a new command in chief to rebuild the militari power i was honor to be flank by colin powel and general norman schwartzkopf recent stood by me side and agre with me if we don t have a clear vision of the militari if we don t stop extend our troop all around the world and nation build mission then we re go to have a serious problem come down the road and i m go to prevent that i m go to rebuild our militari power it s one of the major prioriti of my administr
p3022
aVbush let me just say that obvious tonight we re go to hear some phoni number about what i think and what we ought to do peopl need to know that over the next ten year it is go to be 25 trillion of revenu that come into our treasurey and we anticip spend 21 trillion and my plan say whi don t we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the peopl who pay the bill sure we can afford 5 of the 25 trillion that are come into the treasuri to the hard work peopl that pay the bill there is a differ of opinion my oppon think the govern the surplus is the govern s money that s not what i think i think it s the hard work peopl of america s money and i want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your famili it s a differ of opinion it s a differ between govern make decis for you and you get more of your money to make decis for yourself
p3023
aVgore well they should look at our propos and look at us as peopl and make up their own mind when i was a young man i volunt for the armi i serv my countri in vietnam my father was a senat who strong oppos the vietnam war i went to colleg in this great citi and most of my peer felt against the war as i did but i went anyway becaus i knew if i didn t somebodi els in the small town of carthag tennesse would have to go in my place i serv for eight year in the hous of repres and i serv on the intellig committe special in look at arm control i serv for eight year in the unit state senat and serv on the arm servic committe for the last eight year i ve serv on the nation secur council and when the conflict came up in bosnia i saw a genocid in the heart of europ with the most violent war on the contin of europ sinc world war ii look that s where world war i start my uncl was a victim of poison gas there million of american saw the result of that conflict we have to be will to make good sound judgment incident i know the valu of make sure our troop have the latest technolog the governor has propos skip the next generat of weapon i think that s a big mistak becaus i think we have to stay at the cut edg
p3024
aVbush i think you ve got to look at how one has handl respons in offic whether or not it s the same in domest polici as well whether or not you have the capac to convinc peopl to follow whether or not one make decis base on sound principl or whether or not you reli upon poll or focus group on how to decid what the cours of action is we have too much poll and focus group go on in washington today we need decis made on sound principl i ve been the governor of a big state i think one of the hallmark of my relationship in austin texa is that i ve had the capac to work with both republican and democrat i think that s an import part of leadership i think what it mean to build consensus i ve shown i know how to do so tonight in the audienc there s one elect state senat who is a democrat a former state wide offic who is a democrat a lot of democrat who are here in the debat to becaus they want to show their support that show i know how to lead and so the fundament answer to your question who can lead and who s shown the abil to get thing done
p3025
aVgore if i could say one thing
p3026
aVgore one of the key point in foreign polici and nation secur polici is the need to establish the old fashion principl that polit ought to stop at the water s edg when i was in the unit state congress i work with former presid reagan when i was in the unit state senat i work with former presid bush your father i was one of onli a few democrat in the senat to support the persian gulf war i think bipartisanship is a nation asset we have to find way to reestablish it in foreign polici and nation secur polici
p3027
aVbush yeah whi haven t they done it in seven year
p3028
aVgore oh absolut this is a veri import moment in the histori of our countri look we ve got the biggest surplus in all of american histori the key question that has to be answer in this elect is will we use that prosper wise in a way that benefit all of our peopl and doesn t go just to the few almost half of all the tax cut benefit as i said under governor bush s plan go to the wealthiest 1 i think we have to make the right and respons choic i think we have to invest in educ protect the environ health care a prescript drug benefit that goe to all senior not just to the poor under medicar not reli on hmos and insur compani i think that we have to help parent and strengthen famili by deal with the kind of inappropri entertain materi that famili are just heart sick that their children are expos to i think we ve got to have welfar reform taken to the next stage i think that we have got to balanc the budget everi singl year pay down the nation debt and in fact under my propos the nation debt will be complet elimin by the year 2012 i think we need to put medicar and social secur in a lockbox the governor will not put medicar in a lockbox i don t think it should be use as a piggi bank for other program i think it need to be move out of the budget and protect i ll veto anyth that take money out of social secur or medicar for anyth other than social secur or medicar now the prioriti are just veri differ i ll give you a coupl of exampl for everi new dollar that i propos for spend on health care governor bush spend 3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 now for everi dollar that i propos to spend on educ he spend 5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 those are veri clear differ
p3029
aVbush the man is practic fuzzi math again there s differ under vice presid gore s plan he is go to grow the feder govern in the largest increas sinc lyndon bain johnson in 1965 we re talk about a massiv govern folk we re talk about ad to or increas 200 program 20 000 new bureaucrat imagin how mani ir agent it is go to take to be abl to figur out his target tax cut for the middl class that exclud 50 million american there is a huge differ in this campaign he say he s go to give you tax cut 50 million of you won t receiv it he said in his speech he want to make sure the right peopl get tax relief that s not the role of a presid to decid right and wrong everybodi who pay tax ought to get tax relief after my plan is in place the wealthiest american will pay more tax the poorest of american six million famili won t pay ani tax at all it s a huge differ a differ between big explod feder govern that want to think on your behalf and a plan that meet prioriti and liber work peopl to be abl to make decis on your own
p3030
aVgore you haven t heard the governor deni these number he s call them phoni and fuzzi the fact remain almost 30 of his propos tax cut goe to onli to american that make more than 1 million per year more money goe to the can i have a rebutt here
p3031
aVbush let me tell you what the fact are the fact are after my plan the wealthiest of american pay more tax of the percentag of the whole than they do today second if you re a famili of four make 50 000 in massachusett you get a 50 tax cut let me give you one exampl a famili in allentown pennsylvania i campaign with them the other day they make 51 000 combin incom they pay about 3500 in tax under my plan they get 1800 of tax relief under vice presid gore s plan they get 145 of tax relief now you tell me who stand on the side of the fenc you ask whose plan make more sens there is a differ of opinion he would rather spend the famili s 1800 and i would rather the famili spend that money
p3032
aVgore no i don t and i m not go to go to call name on his fact i m just gonna tell you what the real fact are the analysi that he s talk about leav out more than half of the tax cut that i have propos and if you just add the number up he still hasn t deni it he spend more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 than all his new propos for all his other thing combin now those are the wrong prioriti 665 billion over ten year for the wealthiest 1 as i said almost 30 of it goe to american that make more than 1 million per year everi middl class famili is elig for a tax cut under my propos let me give you some specif exampl i believ colleg tuition up to 10 000 per year ought to be tax deduct so middl class famili can choos to send their children to colleg i believ all senior citizen should be abl to choos their own doctor and get prescript drug from their own pharmacist with medicar pay half the bill i believ parent need more public and charter school choic to send their kid to a safe school we need to make educ the number one prioriti in our countri and treat teacher like the profession that they are and that s whi i have made it a number one prioriti in my budget
p3033
aVbush let me talk about tax cut one more time it exclud 50 million american
p3034
aVgore not so
p3035
aVbush the marriag penalti if you item your tax return you get no marriag penalti relief he pick and choos he decid who the right peopl are it s a fundament differ of opinion i want my fellow american to hear one more time we ll spend 25 trillion we ll collect 25 trillion in revenu in the next 10 year and spend 21 trillion we need to send 5 back to you that pay the bill i want to say someth this man has been disparag my plan with all this washington fuzzi math if you re a singl mother make 22 000 a year and you have two children under this tax code for everi addit dollar you make you pay a higher margin rate on that dollar than someon make more than 200 000 a year and that is not right my plan drop the rate from 15 to 10 and increas the child credit from 500 to 1 000 to make the code more fair for everybodi not just a few not just a hand everybodi who pay tax ought to get some relief
p3036
aVbush i have i have first question is what s in the best interest of the unit state what s in the best interest of our peopl when it come to foreign polici that will be my guid question is it in our nation s interest peac in the middl east is in our nation s interest have a hemispher that is free for trade and peac is in our nation s interest strong relat in europ is in our nation s interest i ve thought a lot about what it mean to be the presid i also understand that an administr is not one person but an administr is dedic citizen who are call by the presid to serv the countri to serv a caus greater than self and so i ve thought about an administr of peopl who repres all america but peopl who understand my compassion and conserv philosophi i haven t start name name except for one person and that s mr richard cheney who i thought did a great job the other night he s a vice presidenti nomine who repres i think peopl got to see whi i pick him he s man of solid judgment and he s go to be a person to stand by my side one of the thing i ve done in texa is i ve been abl to put togeth a good team of peopl i ve been abl to set clear goal the goal ought to be an educ system that leav no child behind medicar for our senior a social secur system that s safe and secur foreign polici that s in our nation s interest and a strong militari and then bring peopl togeth to achiev those goal that s what a chief execut offic doe so i ve thought long and hard about the honor of be the presid of the unit state
p3037
aVgore the first prioriti has to be on end the violenc dampen down the tension that have arisen there we need to call upon syria to releas the three isra soldier who have been captur we need to insist that arafat send out instruct to halt some of the provoc act of violenc that have been go on i think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward saddam hussein becaus he is take advantag of this situat to onc again make threat and he need to understand that he s not onli deal with israel he is deal he s deal with us if he is make the kind of threat that he s talk about there the use of diplomaci in this situat has alreadi well it goe hour by hour and day by day now it s a veri tens situat there but in the last 24 hour there has been some subsid of the violenc there it s too much to hope that this is go to continu but i do hope that it will continu our countri has been veri activ with regular convers with the leader there and we just have to take it day to day right now but one thing i would say where diplomaci is concern israel should feel absolut secur about one thing our bond with israel are larger than agreement or disagr on some detail of diplomat initi they are histor they are strong and they are endur and our abil to serv as an honest broker is someth that we need to shepherd
p3038
aVgore well i had thought that there was a controversi at the end of the legisl session where the hate crime law in texa was fail and that the byrd famili among other ask you to support it governor and it die in committe for lack of support am i wrong about that
p3039
aVbush well you don t realiz we have a hate crime statut we do gore i m talk about the one that was propos to deal
p3040
aVbush no well what the vice presid must not understand is we ve got a hate crime bill in texa and second the peopl that murder mr byrd got the ultim punish the death penalti
p3041
aVbush in this case when you murder somebodi it s hate jim the crime is hate and they got the ultim punish i m not exact sure how you enhanc the penalti ani more than the death penalti we happen to have a statut on the book that s a hate crime statut in texa
p3042
aVgore may i respond
p3043
aVgore i don t want to jump in i may have been misl by all the news report about this matter becaus the law that was propos in texa that had the support of the byrd famili and a whole lot of peopl in texa did in fact die in committe there may be some other statut that was alreadi on the book but certain the advoc of the hate crime law felt that a tough new law was need and it s import jim not onli not just becaus of texa but becaus this mirror the nation controversi there is pend now in the congress a nation hate crime law becaus of jame byrd becaus of matthew shepard who was crucifi on a split rail fenc by bigot and becaus of other and that law has die in committe also becaus of the same kind of opposit
p3044
aVgore absolut
p3045
aVbush i would support the orrin hatch version of it not the senat kennedi version but let me say to you mr vice presid we re happi with our law on our book that bill did there was anoth bill that did die in committe but i want to repeat if you have a state that fulli support the law like we do in texa we re go to go after all crime and we re go to make sure peopl get punish for the crime and in this case we can t enhanc the penalti ani more than put those three thug to death and that s what s gonna happen in the state of texa
p3046
aVbush i m not for gay marriag i think marriag is a sacr institut between a man and a woman and i appreci the way the administr sign the defens of marriag act i presum the vice presid support it when the presid sign that bill and support it now but i think marriag is a sacr institut i m go to be respect for peopl who may disagre with me i ve had a record of do so in the state of texa i ve been a person that had been call a unit not a divid becaus i accept other peopl s point of view but i feel strong that marriag should be between a man and a woman
p3047
aVgore i agre with that and i did support that law but i think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic union and i basic agre with dick cheney and joe lieberman and i think the three of us have one view and the governor has anoth view
p3048
aVbush i m not sure what kind of view he s describ to me i can just tell you i m a person who respect other peopl i respect their i respect on the one hand he say he agre with me and then he say he doesn t i m not sure where he s come from but i will be a toler person i ve been a toler person all my life i just happen to believ strong that marriag is between a man and a woman
p3049
aVbush yes i don t think they ought to have special right but i think they ought to have the same right
p3050
aVbush well i think dure the campaign particular now dure this difficult period we ought to be speak with one voic and i appreci the way the administr has work hard to calm the tension like the vice presid i call on chairman arafat to have his peopl pull back to make the peac i think credibl is go to be veri import in the futur in the middl east i want everybodi to know should i be the presid israel s go to be our friend i m go to stand by israel second that i think it s import to reach out to moder arab nation like jordan and egypt saudi arabia and kuwait it s import to be friend with peopl when you don t need each other so that when you do there s a strong bond of friendship and that s go to be particular import in deal not onli with situat such as now occur in israel but with saddam hussein the coalit against saddam has fallen apart or it s unravel let s put it that way the sanction are be violat we don t know whether he s develop weapon of mass destruct he better not be or there s go to be a consequ should i be the presid but it s import to have credibl and credibl is form by be strong with your friend and resolut your determin one of the reason whi i think it s import for this nation to develop an anti ballist missil system that we can share with our alli in the middl east if need be to keep the peac is to be abl to say to the saddam hussein of the world or the iranian don t dare threaten our friend it s also import to keep strong tie in the middl east credibl tie becaus of the energi crisi we re now in after all a lot of the energi is produc from the middl east and so i appreci what the administr is do i hope to get a sens of should i be fortun to be the presid how my administr will react to the middl east
p3051
aVgore well there s a law pend call the employ non discrimin act i strong support it what it say is that gay and lesbian can t be fire from their job becaus they re gay or lesbian and it would be a feder law prevent that now i wonder if the it s been block by the oppon in the major in the congress i wonder if the governor who lend his support to that law
p3052
aVbush the question
p3053
aVbush well i have no idea i mean he can throw out all kind i don t know the particular of this law i will tell you i m the kind of person i don t hire or fire somebodi base upon their sexual orient as a matter of fact i would like to take the issu a littl further i don t realli think it s ani of my you know ani of my concern what how you conduct your sex life and i think that s a privat matter and i think that s the way it ought to be but i m go to be respect for peopl i ll toler peopl and i support equal right but not special right for peopl
p3054
aVbush well it would be if they re given special protect status that doesn t mean we shouldn t fulli enforc law and fulli protect peopl and fulli honor peopl which i will do as the presid of the unit state
p3055
aVgore jim i hope that we can come back to the subject of educ becaus the governor made an extens statement on it and i have a veri differ view than the one he express but that have been said i believ that well first of all let me say that the governor and i agre on some thing where this subject is concern i will not do anyth to affect the right of hunter or sportsmen i think that homeown have to be respect and their right to have a gun if they wish to the problem i see is that there are too mani gun get into the hand of children and crimin and peopl who for whatev reason some kind of histori of stalk or domest abus realli should not be abl to get gun i think these assault weapon are a problem so i favor close the gun show loophol in fact i cast the tie break vote to close it but then the major in the hous of repres went the other way that s still pend if we could get agreement on that mayb they could pass that in the final day of this congress i think we ought to restor the three day wait period under the bradi law i think we should toughen the enforc of gun law so that the one that are alreadi on the book can be enforc much more effect some of the restrict that have been place by the congress in the last coupl of year i think in the last few year i think have been unfortun i think that we ought to make all school gun free have a gun free zone around everi school in this countri i think that measur like these are import child safeti trigger lock on a mandatori basi and other
p3056
aVbush well it start with enforc law when you say loud and clear to somebodi if you re go to carri a gun illeg we re go to arrest you if you re go to sell a gun illeg you need to be arrest if you commit a crime with a gun there need to be absolut certainti in the law and that mean that the local law enforc offici need help at the feder level program like project exil where the feder govern intensifi arrest peopl who illeg use gun and we haven t done a veri good job of that at the feder level recent and i m go to make it a prioriti second i don t think we ought to be sell gun to peopl who shouldn t have them that s whi i support instant background check at gun show one of the reason we have an instant background check is so that we instant know whether or not somebodi should have a gun or not in texa i tri to do someth innov there s a lot of talk about trigger lock be on gun sold in the futur i support that but i said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe come and get one for free so we re distribut in our state of texa for free i think we ought to rais the age at which a juvenil can carri a handgun from 18 to 21 i disagre with the vice presid on this issu he is for registr of gun i think the onli peopl that are go to show up to regist or get a licens i guess licens like a driver s licens for a gun the onli peopl that are go to show up are law abid citizen the crimin is not go to show up and say hey give me my i d card it s the law abid citizen who will do that an i don t think that is go to be an effect tool to make the keep our societi safe
p3057
aVgore well i m not for registr i am for licens by state of new handgun purchas
p3058
aVgore a photo licens i d like a driver s licens for new handgun and you know the los angel
p3059
aVgore correct
p3060
aVgore the state the state i think state should do that for new handgun becaus too mani crimin are get gun there was a recent investig of the number in texa who got who were given conceal weapon permit in spite of the fact that they had record and the los angel time spent a lot of ink go into that but i am not for do anyth that would affect hunter or sportsmen rifl shotgun exist handgun i do think that sensibl gun safeti measur are warrant now look this is the year this is in the aftermath of columbin and paducah and all the place in our countri where the nation has been shock by these weapon in the hand of the wrong peopl the woman who bought the gun for the two boy who did that kill at columbin said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there she would not have bought those gun that conceiv could have prevent that tragedi
p3061
aVgore well we stand with israel but we have maintain the abil to serv as an honest broker and one of the reason that s import is that israel cannot have direct dialogu with some of the peopl on the other side of conflict especi dure time of tension unless that dialogu come through us and if we throw away that abil to serv as an honest broker then we have thrown we will have thrown away a strateg asset that s import not onli to us but also to israel
p3062
aVbush well i m not for photo licens let me say someth about columbin listen we ve got gun law he say we ought to have gun free school everybodi believ that i m sure everi state in the union has got them you can t carri a gun into a school and there ought to be a consequ when you do carri a gun into a school but columbin spoke to a larger issu it s realli a matter of cultur it s a cultur that somewher along the line we ve begun to disrespect life where a child can walk in and have their heart turn dark as a result of be on the internet and walk in and decid to take somebodi els s life so gun law are import no question about it but so is love children and charact educ class and faith base program be a part of after school program some desper child need to have somebodi put their arm around them and say we love you so there s a this is a societi that of our that s got to do a better job of teach children right from wrong and we can enforc law but there seem to be a lot of preoccup on not certain onli in this debat but just in general on law but there s a larger law love your neighbor like you would like to be love yourself and that s where our societi must head if we re go to be a peac and prosper societi
p3063
aVgore i also believ in the golden rule and i agre with a lot of the other thing that the governor has said we do have a serious problem in our cultur tipper and i have work on the problem of violenc in entertain aim at children she s work on it longer than i have but i feel veri strong about that and if i m elect presid i will do someth about that but i think that we i think we have to start with better parent but i don t think that we can ignor the role play by gun i mean the fact is that there even though no state want them there are gun in some school and the reason it s so difficult for school to control that is becaus in recent year there has been a flood of cheap handgun that are so wide avail that kid are find way to get ahold of them and i think that if you look at the situat as it exist here in the unit state compar to ani other countri in the world it seem to me pretti obvious that while we respect the right of hunter and sportsmen we do need some common sens gun safeti step to stem this flood of gun that are get into the wrong hand
p3064
aVbush yeah no question about that but there also need to be strong enforc of the law some kid who feel like doesn t matter where the gun come from it could be a cheap gun expens gun what matter is someth in this person s head say there is not go to be a consequ so in my state we toughen up the juvenil justic law we ad bed we re tough we believ in tough love we say if you get caught carri a gun you re automat detain and that s what need to happen we ve got law if law need to be strengthen like instant background check that s import
p3065
aVbush well i ve got a plan to do someth about that it s to make health care afford and avail this way first there s some who should be buy health care who choos not to there s some
p3066
aVbush some of the healthi folk healthi young kid say i ll never get sick therefor i don t need health care right now for those what i think we need to do is to develop an invest type vehicl that would be an incent for them to invest like medic save account with rollov capac in other word you say to a youngster it will be in your financi interest to start save for futur ill but for the work folk that do want to have health care that can t afford it a coupl of thing we need to do one we need more communiti health center i ve develop put out money in my budget to expand communiti health center all around the countri these are place where peopl can get primari care second and they re good they re veri import part of the safeti net of health care second that you get a 2 000 rebat from the govern if you re a famili of 30 000 or less it scale down as you get higher that you can use to purchas health care in the privat market it will be a huge down payment for a pretti darn good system if you allow also allow convinc state to allow state to allow the mother to match some of the children s health insur money with it the pool purchas power and to make health care more afford allow busi associ like the nation feder of independ busi or the chamber of commerc or the nation restaur associ to write associ plan across jurisdict line so that small busi have got the capac to have nation pool to drive the cost of insur down i think that s the veri best way to go it empow peopl it trust peopl it make and it s a practic way to encourag peopl to purchas health care insur
p3067
aVgore it s one of my top prioriti jim to give everi singl child in the unit state afford health care within the next four year i would like to see eventu in this countri some form of univers health care but i m not for a govern run system in fact i m for shrink the size of govern i want a smaller and smarter govern i have been in charg of this reinvent govern streamlin project that s reduc the size of govern by more than 300 000 peopl in the last sever year and the budget plan that i ve put out accord to the los angel time again the way these thing are typic measur as a percentag of the gdp will bring govern spend down to the lowest level in 50 year so i want to proceed care to cover more peopl but i think we should start by great expand the so call child health insur or chip program to give health insur to everi singl child in this countri i think it s intoler that we have so mani million of children without ani health insur so it s one of my top prioriti now i know that we have some disagr on this and i m sorri to tell you that you know there is a record here and texa rank 49th out of the 50 state in health care in children with health care 49th for women with health care and 50th for famili with health care so it is a prioriti for me i guarante you i m not awar of ani program well i ll just leav it at that i think it ought to be a top prioriti
p3068
aVbush first of all let me say he s not for a govern run health care system i thought that s exact what he and mrs clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a govern run health care system it was fortun stop in it track second we spend 4 7 billion a year on the uninsur in the state of texa our rate of uninsur the percentag of uninsur in texa has gone down while the percentag of uninsur in america has gone up our chip program got a late start becaus our govern meet onli four month out of everi two year mr vice presid it may come as a shock for somebodi who has been in washington for so long but actual limit govern can work in the second largest state in the union and therefor congress pass the bill after our session in 1997 end we pass an enabl legisl in 1999 we ve sign up over 110 000 children to the chip program for compar state our size we re sign them up as fast as ani other state you can quot all the number you want but i m tell you we care about our peopl in texa we spent a lot of money to make sure peopl get health care in the state of texa and we re do a better job than they are at the nation level for reduc uninsur
p3069
aVgore well i don t know about all these percentag that he throw out but i do know that i specul that the reason whi he didn t answer your question direct as to whether my number were right the fact were right about texa rank dead last in famili with health insur and 49th out of 50 for both children and women is becaus those fact are correct and as for whi it happen i m no expert on the texa procedur but what my friend there tell me is that the governor oppos a measur put forward by democrat in the legislatur to expand the number of children that would be cover and instead direct the money toward a tax cut a signific part of which went to wealthi interest he declar the need for a new tax cut for the oil compani in texa an emerg need and so the money was taken away from the chip program there s you don t have to take my word for this there is now a feder judg s opinion about the current manag of this program order the state of texa to do you should read that judg s languag about this i believ there are 1 4 million children in texa who do not have health insur 600 000 of whom and mayb some of those have sinc gotten it but as of a year ago 600 000 of them were actual elig for it but they couldn t sign up for it becaus of the barrier that they had set up
p3070
aVbush if he s tri to alleg that i m a hard heart person and i don t care about children he s absolut wrong we ve spent 4 7 billion a year in the state of texa for uninsur peopl and they get health care now it s not the most effici way to get peopl health care but i want to remind you the number of uninsur in america dure their watch has increas he can make ani excus he want but the fact are that we re reduc the number of uninsur percentag of our popul and as the percentag of the popul is increas nation somehow the alleg that we don t care and we re go to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the state of texa is total absurd let me just tell you who the juri is the peopl of texa there s onli been one governor ever elect to back to back four year term and that was me and i was abl to do so with a lot of democrat vote near 50 of the hispan vote about 27 of the african american vote becaus peopl know i m a conserv person and a compassion person so he can throw all the kind of number around i m just tell you our state come togeth to do what is right we come togeth both republican and democrat
p3071
aVgore yes yes but it s not a statement about his heart i don t claim to know his heart i think he s a good person i make no alleg about that i believ him when he say that he has a good heart i know enough about your stori to admir a lot of the thing that you have done as a person but i think it s about his prioriti and let me tell you exact whi i think that the choic he made to give a tax cut for the oil compani and other befor address this i mean if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for famili and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in it histori wouldn t you want to mayb use some of it to climb from 50th to say 45 or 40 or someth or mayb better i would now but here is whi it s direct relev jim becaus by his own budget number his propos for spend on tax cut for the wealthiest of the wealthi are more than the new spend propos that he has made for health care and educ and nation defens all combin accord to his own number so it s not a question of his heart as far as i know it s a question of prioriti and valu see you know
p3072
aVbush first of all that s simpli not true what he just said of cours and second i repeat to you
p3073
aVbush i do i do think this though when it come to timet it can t be the unit state timet as to how discuss take place it s got to be a timet that all parti can agre to like the palestinian and isra second ani last peac is go to have to be a peac that s good for both side and therefor the term honest broker make sens this current administr s work hard to keep the parti at the tabl i will tri to do the same thing but it won t be on my timet it will be on the timet that peopl are comfort with in the middl east
p3074
aVbush that we spent the top 1 receiv 223 as oppos to 445 billion in new spend the top let s talk about my tax plan the top 1 will pay one third of all the feder incom tax and in return get one fifth of the benefit becaus most of the tax reduct go to the peopl at the bottom end of the econom ladder that stand in stark contrast by the way to a man who is go to leav 50 million 50 million american out of tax relief we just have a differ point of view it s a total differ point of view he believ onli the right peopl ought to get tax relief i believ everybodi who pay tax ought to get tax relief let me go back to texa for exampl for a minut we pay 4 7 billion i can t emphas to you how much i sign a bill that put chip in place the bill final came out at the end of the 1999 session we re work hard to sign up children we re do it faster than ani other state our size compar state we re make realli good progress and our state care a lot about our children my prioriti is go to be the health of our citizen these folk have had eight year to get someth done in washington d c on the uninsur they have not done it they ve had eight year to get someth done on medicar and they have not got it done and my case to the american peopl is if you re happi with inact stay with the hors the hors is up there now but if you want chang you need to get somebodi that know how to bring republican and democrat togeth to get posit thing done for american
p3075
aVgore i do i think that in this 21st centuri we will soon see the consequ of what s call global warm there was a studi just a few week ago suggest that in summertim the north polar ice cap will be complet gone in 50 year alreadi peopl see the strang weather condit that the old timer say they ve never seen befor in their lifetim and what s happen is the level of pollut is increas signific now here is the good news jim if we take the leadership role and build the new technolog like the new kind of car and truck that detroit is itch to build then we can creat million of good new job by be first into the market with these new kind of car and truck and other kind of technolog you know the japanes are breath down our neck on this they re move veri rapid becaus they know that it is a fast grow world market some of these other countri particular in the develop world their pollut is much wors than anywher els and their peopl want higher standard of live and so they re look for way to satisfi their desir for a better life and still reduc pollut at the same time i think that hold onto the old way and the old argument that the environ and the economi are in conflict is realli outdat we have to be bold we have to provid leadership now it s true that we disagre on this the governor said that he doesn t think this problem is necessarili caus by peopl he s for let the oil compani into the arctic nation wildlif refug houston has just becom the smoggiest citi in the countri and texa is number one in industri pollut we have a veri differ outlook and i ll tell you this i will fight for a clean environ in way that strengthen our economi
p3076
aVbush well let me start with texa we are a big industri state we reduc our industri wast by 11 we clean up more brown field than ani other administr in my state s histori 450 of them our water is cleaner now
p3077
aVbush a brown field is an abandon industri site that just sit idl in some of our urban center and peopl are will to invest capit in the brown field don t want to do so for fear of lawsuit i think we ought to have feder liabil protect depend upon whether or not standard have been met the book you mention that vice presid gore wrote he also call for tax big energi tax in order to clean up the environ and now that the energi price are high i guess he s not advoc those big energi tax right now i believ we ought to fulli fund the land and water conserv fund to with half the money go to state so state can make the right decis for environment qualiti i think we need to have clean coal technolog i propos 2 billion worth by the way i just found out the other day an interest fact that there is a nation petroleum reserv right next to in prudho bay that your administr open up for explor in that pristin area and it was a smart move becaus there s gas reserv up there we need gas pipelin to bring the gas down gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plant that there s mandatori that the plant must conform to clean air standard the grandfath plant that s what we did in texa no excus you must conform in other word there are practic thing we can do but it start with work in a collabor effort with state and local folk if you own the land everi day is earth day peopl care a lot about their land and care about their environ not all wisdom is in washington d c on this issu
p3078
aVgore i m realli strong commit to clean water and clean air and clean up the new kind of challeng like global warm he is right that i m not in favor of energi tax i am in favor of tax cut to encourag and give incent for the quicker develop of these new kind of technolog and let me say again detroit is rear to go on that we differ on the arctic nation wildlif refug as i have said we differ on whether or not pollut control ought to be voluntari i don t think you can i don t think you can get result that way we differ on the kind of appoint that we would make
p3079
aVgore i think it s a fundament differ let me give you an exampl
p3080
aVgore okay sure
p3081
aVbush well i don t believ in command and control out of washington d c i believ washington ought to set standard but again i think we ought to be collabor at the local level and i think we ought to work with peopl at the local level and by the way i just want to make sure i can t let him just say someth and not correct it the electr decontrol bill that i fought for and sign in texa has mandatori emiss standard mr vice presid that s what we ought to do at the feder level when it come to grandfath plant for util i think there s a differ i think for exampl take when they took 40 million acr of land out of circul without consult local offici i thought that was
p3082
aVbush out in the west yeah and so on the log issu that s not the way i would have done it perhap some of that land need to be set asid but i certain would have consult with governor and elect offici befor i would have act unilater
p3083
aVbush sure absolut so long as they re base upon scienc and they re reason so long as peopl have input
p3084
aVgore i haven t heard a big differ in the last few exchang
p3085
aVbush i think it s an issu that we need to take veri serious but i don t think we know the solut to global warm yet and i don t think we ve got all the fact befor we make decis i tell you one thing i m not go to do is i m not go to let the unit state carri the burden for clean up the world s air like kyoto treati would have done china and india were exempt from that treati i think we need to be more even hand as evid 99 senat i think it was 99 senat support that posit
p3086
aVbush 99 to noth
p3087
aVgore well that vote wasn t exact a lot of the support of the kyoto treati actual end up vote for that becaus the way it was word but there s no doubt there s a lot of opposit to it in the senat i m not for command and control techniqu either i m for work with the group not just with industri but also with the citizen group and local communiti to control sprawl in way that the local communiti themselv come up with but i disagre that we don t know the caus of global warm i think that we do it s pollut carbon dioxid and other chemic that are even more potent but in smaller quantiti that caus this look the world s temperatur is go up weather pattern are chang storm are get more violent and unpredict what are we go to tell our children i m a grandfath now i want to be abl to tell my grandson when i m in my later year that i didn t turn away from the evid that show that we were do some serious harm in my faith tradit it is it s written in the book of matthew where your heart is there is your treasur also and i believ that that we ought to recogn the valu to our children and grandchildren of take step that preserv the environ in a way that s good for them
p3088
aVbush yeah i agre i just i think there has been some of the scientist i believ mr vice presid haven t they been chang their opinion a littl bit on global warm a profound scientist recent made a differ
p3089
aVgore i ve been tri so hard not to
p3090
aVbush twice
p3091
aVbush that s hard to tell i think that you know i would hope to be abl to convinc peopl i could handl the iraqi situat better
p3092
aVgore that s an interrupt by the way
p3093
aVbush i m sorri i apolog mr vice presid
p3094
aVbush of cours they care about them oh you mean the rule
p3095
aVbush what the heck i of cours there s a lot look global warm need to be taken veri serious and i take it serious but scienc there s a lot there s differ opinion and befor we react i think it s best to have the full account full understand of what s take place and i think to answer your question i think both of us care a lot about the environ we may have differ approach we may have differ approach in term of how we deal with local folk i just cite an exampl of the administr just unilater act without ani input and i rememb you gave a veri good answer to new hampshir about the white mountain about how it was import to keep that collabor effort in place i feel veri strong the same place it certain wasn t the attitud that took place out west howev
p3096
aVbush well we all make mistak i ve been known to mangl a syllabl or two myself you know if you know what i mean i think credibl is import it is go to be import for the presid to be credibl with congress import for the presid to be credibl with foreign nation and yes i think it s someth that peopl need to consid this isn t someth new i read a report or a memo from somebodi in his 1988 campaign i forgot the fellow s name warn then senat gore to be care about exagger claim i thought dure his debat with senat bradley say he author the eitc when it didn t happen i mention the last debat
p3097
aVgore yes jim i ve thought a lot about that particular question and i see our greatest nation strength come from what we stand for in the world i see it as a question of valu it is a great tribut to our founder that 224 year later this nation is now look to by the peopl on everi other contin and the peopl from everi part of this earth as a kind of model for what their futur could be and i don t think that s just the kind of exagger that we take pride in as american it s realli true even the one that sometim shake their fist at us as soon as they have a chang that allow the peopl to speak freeli they re want to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more freedom free market polit freedom so i think first and foremost our power ought to be wield to in way that form a more perfect union the power of exampl is america s greatest power in the world and that mean for exampl stand up for human right it mean address the problem of injustic and inequ along the line of race and ethnic here at home becaus in all these other place around the world where they re have these terribl problem when they feel hope it is often becaus they see in us a reflect of their potenti so we ve got to enforc our civil right law we ve got to deal with thing like racial profil and we have to keep our militari strong we have the strongest militari and i ll do whatev is necessari if i m presid to make sure that it stay that way but our real power come i think from our valu
p3098
aVbush the earn incom tax credit sorri
p3099
aVbush a lot of initi from a guy who s not from washington isn t it anyway he co sponsor mccain feingold and yet he didn t and so i think this is an issu i found it to be an issu in tri to defend my tax relief packag i thought there was some exagger about the number but the peopl are go to have to make up their mind on this issu and i am go to continu to defend my record and defend my proposit against what i think are exagger exagger like for exampl onli 5 of senior receiv benefit under my medicar reform packag that s what he said the other day and that s simpli not the case and i have everi right in the world to defend my record and posit that s what debat are about and that s what campaign are about
p3100
aVgore i got some of the detail wrong last week in some of the exampl that i use jim and i m sorri about that and i m go to tri to do better one of the reason i regret it is that get a detail wrong interf sever time with the point that i was tri to make howev mani day that young girl in florida stood in her classroom howev long even if it was onli one day doesn t chang the fact that there are a lot of overcrowd classroom in america and we need to do someth about that there are senior who pay more for their prescript than a lot of other peopl more than their pet sometim more sometim than peopl in foreign countri and we need to do someth about that not with the measur that leav the major of them without ani real basic help until the next presid s term of four year is over but right away and that mean do it under the medicar program i can t promis that i will never get anoth detail wrong i can promis you that i will tri not to and hard but i will promis you this with all the confid in my heart and in the world that i will do my best if i m elect presid i ll work my heart out to get the big thing right for the american peopl
p3101
aVbush that s go to be up to the peopl isn t it
p3102
aVbush depend on what he say in the futur in the campaign
p3103
aVbush i would like to of cours and i presum this administr would as well we don t know there are no inspector now in iraq the coalit that was in place isn t as strong as it use to be he is a danger we don t want him fish in troubl water in the middl east and it s go to be hard it s go to be import to rebuild that coalit to keep the pressur on him
p3104
aVbush i hope they re not aw thing i think they may be use the man s own word
p3105
aVbush i don t believ i ve use those word
p3106
aVbush mayb they have
p3107
aVbush wait a minut laughter
p3108
aVgore i don t use languag like that and i don t think that we should
p3109
aVgore i understand the i haven t seen that in my commerci
p3110
aVbush you haven t seen the commerci
p3111
aVgore i think that what i think the point of that is that anybodi would have a hard time tri to make a tax cut plan that is so larg that would put us into such big deficit that give almost half the benefit to the wealthiest of the wealthi i think anybodi would have a hard time explain that clear in a way that make sens to the averag person
p3112
aVbush that s the kind of exagger i was just talk about laughter
p3113
aVgore well i wasn t the one have troubl explain it
p3114
aVgore jim one of the issu that i would like to close with in my statement is educ becaus it s an exampl of the overal approach that i think is import this race is about valu it s about chang it s about give choic to the american peopl and educ is my number one prioriti becaus i think that it s the most import big major chang that we can bring in our countri i agre with governor bush that we should have new account test of student i think that we should requir state to test all student test school and school district and i think that we should go further and requir teacher test for new teacher also the differ is that while my plan start with new account and maintain local control it doesn t stop there becaus i want to give new choic to parent to send their kid to colleg with a 10 000 tax deduct for colleg tuition per child per year i want to reduc the size of the classroom in this countri for one basic reason so that student can get more one on one time with teacher and the way to do that is first to recruit more teacher i ve a plan in my budget to recruit 100 000 new high qualifi teacher and to help local school district build new school i think that we have to put more emphasi on earli learn and pre school now here is how that connect with all the rest of what we ve been talk about if you have if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goe most to those at the top then you can t make educ the top prioriti if the tax cut is your number one two three and four prioriti you can t do educ you can t do both you have to choos i choos educ and health care the environ and retir secur and i ask for your support
p3115
aVbush jim thank you veri much mr vice presid thank you veri much and i would like to thank the folk here at wake forest and i want to thank you all for listen i m run to get some thing done for america there s too mani issu left unresolv there s been too much finger point and too much name call in washington d c i would like to unit this countri to get an agenda done that will speak to the hope and aspir of the futur i want to have an educ system that set high standard local control of school and strong account no child should be left behind in america i want to make sure we rebuild our militari to keep the peac i worri about moral in today s militari the warn sign are clear it is time to have a new command in chief who will rebuild the militari pay our men and women more make sure they re hous better and have a focus mission for our militari onc and for all i want to do someth about medicar this issu has been too long on the tabl becaus it s been a polit issu it s time to bring folk togeth to say that all senior will get prescript drug coverag i want to do someth about social secur it s an import prioriti becaus now is the time to act and we re go to say to our senior our promis we ve made to you will be promis kept but younger worker in order to make sure the system exist tomorrow younger worker ought to be abl to take some of your own money and invest it in safe secur to get a better rate of return on that money and final i do believ in tax relief i believ we can set our prioriti i don t believ like the vice presid doe in huge govern i believ in limit govern by have a limit govern and a focus govern we can send some of the money back to the peopl who pay the bill i want to have tax relief for all peopl who pay the bill in america becaus i think you can spend your money more wise than the feder govern can thank you for listen i m ask for your vote and god bless
p3116
aVbush i do
p3117
aVgore well when i got to be a part of the current administr it was right after i was one of the few member of my polit parti to support former presid bush in the persian gulf war resolut and at the end of that war for whatev reason it was not finish in a way that remov saddam hussein from power i know there are all kind of circumst and explan but the fact is that that s the situat that was left when i got there and we have maintain the sanction now i want to go further i want to give robust support to the group that are tri to overthrow saddam hussein and i know there are alleg that they re too weak to do it but that s what they said about the forc that were oppos milosev in serbia and you know the polici of enforc sanction against serbia has just result in a spectacular victori for democraci just in the past week and it seem to me that have taken so long to see the sanction work there build upon the polici of contain that was success over a much longer period of time against the former soviet union in the communist block seem a littl earli to declar that we should give up on the sanction i know the governor s not necessarili say that but you know all of these flight that have come in all of them have been in accord with the sanction regim i m told except for three where they notifi and they re tri to break out of the box there s no question about it i don t think they should be allow to
p3118
aVbush no of cours not absolut not i want them to be tougher
p3119
aVbush i think it s a triumph i thought the presid made the right decis in join nato and bomb serbia i support them when they did so i call upon the congress not to hamstr the administr and in term of forc troop withdraw on a timet that wasn t necessarili in our best interest or fit our nation s strategi and so i think it s good public polici i think it work and i m pleas i took made the decis i made i m pleas the presid made the decis he made becaus freedom to go in that part of the world and where there s a lot of work left to be done howev
p3120
aVbush yes i think it is absolut i don t think he would have fallen had we not use the forc and i know there are some in our parti that disagre with that sentiment i support the presid i thought he made the right decis to do so i didn t think he necessarili made the right decis to take land troop off the tabl right befor we commit ourselv offens but nevertheless it work the administr deserv credit for have made it work it is import for nato to have it work it s import for nato to be strong and confid and to help keep the peac in europ and one of the reason i felt so strong that the unit state need to particip was becaus of our relat with nato and nato is go to be an import part of keep the peac in the futur now there s more work to do remain to be seen howev whether or not there s go to be a polit settlement in kosovo and i certain hope there is one also on record as say at some point in time i hope our european friend becom the peacekeep in bosnia and in the balkan i hope that they put the troop on the ground so that we can withdraw our troop and focus our militari on fight and win war
p3121
aVgore well i ve been kind of a hard liner on this issu for more than eight year when i was in the senat befor i becam vice presid i was push for stronger action against milosev he caus the death of so mani peopl he was the last communist parti boss there and then he becam a dictat that by some other label he was still essenti a communist dictat and unfortun now he is tri to reassert himself in serbian polit alreadi just today the member of his polit parti said that they were go to ignor the order of the new presid of serbia and that they question his legitimaci and he s still go to tri to be activ involv he is an indict war crimin he should be held account now i did want to pick up on one of the statement earlier and mayb i have heard mayb i have heard the previous statement wrong governor in some of the discuss we ve had about when it s appropri for the u s to use forc around the world at time the standard that you ve laid down have given me the impress that if it s someth like a genocid take place or what they call ethnic cleans in bosnia that that alon would not be that that wouldn t be the kind of situat that would caus you to think that the u s ought to get involv with troop now have to be other factor involv for me to want to be involv but by itself that to me can bring into play a fundament american strateg interest becaus i think it s base on our valu now have i got that wrong
p3122
aVbush if i think it s in our nation s strateg interest i ll commit troop i thought it was in our strateg interest to keep milosev in check becaus of our relat in nato and that s whi i took the posit i took i think it s import for nato to be strong and confid i felt like uncheck milosev would harm nato and so it depend on the situat mr vice presid
p3123
aVgore can you run through the list again
p3124
aVgore i thought that was a mistak
p3125
aVgore i support that
p3126
aVbush well i think they ought to look at us as a countri that understand freedom where it doesn t matter who you are or how you re rais or where you re from that you can succeed i don t think they ll look at us with envi it realli depend upon how our nation conduct itself in foreign polici if we re an arrog nation they ll resent us if we re a humbl nation but strong they ll welcom us and it s our nation stand alon right now in the world in term of power and that s whi we have to be humbl and yet project strength in a way that promot freedom so i don t think they ought to look at us in ani way other than what we are we re a freedom love nation and if we re an arrog nation they ll view us that way but if we re a humbl nation they ll respect us
p3127
aVgore i support that
p3128
aVgore yes i vote for it support it
p3129
aVgore of cours and that again no i think that that was ill consid i did support it at the time it was in the previous administr in the bush quayl administr and i think in retrospect the lesson there are one that we should take veri veri serious
p3130
aVgore oh yes
p3131
aVgore yes
p3132
aVgore yes
p3133
aVbush make a coupl comment
p3134
aVbush start off as a humanitarian mission and it chang into a nation build mission and that s where the mission went wrong the mission was chang and as a result our nation paid a price and so i don t think our troop ought to be use for what s call nation build i think our troop ought to be use to fight and win war i think our troop ought to be use to help overthrow the dictat when it s in our best interest but in this case it was a nation build exercis and same with haiti i wouldn t have support either
p3135
aVbush yes
p3136
aVbush yes
p3137
aVgore i agre with that i agre with that i think that one of the problem that we have face in the world is that we are so much more power than ani singl nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at ani time in histori that i know about anyway that there is some resent of u s power so i think that the idea of humil is an import one but i think that we also have to have a sens of mission in the world we have to protect our capac to push forward what america s all about that mean not onli militari strength and our valu it also mean keep our economi strong you know in the last or two decad ago it was routin for leader of foreign countri to come over here and say you guy have got to do someth about these horrend deficit becaus it s caus tremend problem for the rest of the world and we were lectur to all the time the fact that we have the strongest economi in histori today is not good enough we need to do more but the fact that it is so strong enabl us to project the power for good that america can repres
p3138
aVbush yes some of them i ve got a conflict of interest on if you know what i mean
p3139
aVbush i think the administr did the right thing in that case i do it was a horribl situat no one like to see it on our tv screen but it s a case where we need to make sure we have an earli warn system in place in place where there could be ethnic cleans and genocid the way we saw it there in rwanda and that s a case where we need to use our influenc to have countri in africa come togeth and help deal with the situat the administr seem like we re have a great love for us tonight but the administr made the right decis on train nigerian troop for situat just such as this in rwanda and so i thought they made the right decis not to send u s troop into rwanda
p3140
aVgore i d like to come back to the question of nation build but let me address the question direct first fine we did actual send troop into rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measur my wife tipper who is here actual went on a militari plane with general sholicatchvi on one of those flight but i think in retrospect we were too late get in there we could have save more live if we had act earlier but i do not think that it was an exampl of a conflict where we should have put our troop in to tri to separ the parti for this reason jim one of the criteria that i think is import in decid when and if we should ever get involv around the world is whether or not our nation secur interest is involv if we can realli make the differ with militari forc we tri everyth els if we have alli in the balkan we have alli nato readi will and abl to go and carri a big part of the burden in africa we did not now we have tri our countri tri to creat an africa crisi respons team there and we ve met some resist we have had some luck with nigeria but in sierra leon and now that nigeria has becom a democraci and we hope it stay that way then mayb we can build on that but becaus we had no alli and becaus it was veri unclear that we could actual accomplish what we would want to accomplish about put militari forc there i think it was the right thing not to jump in as heartbreak as it was but i think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission
p3141
aVbush well i understand and africa is import and we ve got to do a lot of work in africa to promot democraci and trade and there are some vice presid mention nigeria is a fledgl democraci we have to work with nigeria that s an import contin but there s got to be prioriti and middl east is a prioriti for a lot of reason as is europ and the far east our own hemispher and those are my four top prioriti should i be the presid not to say we won t be engag nor work hard to get other nation to come togeth to prevent atroc i thought the best exampl of a way to handl the situat was east timor when we provid logist support to the australian support that onli we can provid i thought that was a good model but we can t be all thing to all peopl in the world jim and i think that s where mayb the vice presid and i begin to have some differ i m worri about overcommit our militari around the world i want to be judici in it use you mention haiti i wouldn t have sent troop to haiti i didn t think it was a mission worthwhil it was a nation build mission and it was not veri success it cost us billion a coupl billion of dollar and i m not so sure democraci is ani better off in haiti than it was befor
p3142
aVgore i don t think we agre on that i would certain also be judici in evalu ani potenti use of american troop oversea i think we have to be veri retic about that but look jim the world is chang so rapid the way i see it the world is get much closer togeth like it or not we are now the unit state is now the natur leader of the world all these other countri are look to us now just becaus we cannot be involv everywher and shouldn t be doesn t mean that we should shi away from go in anywher now both of us are kind of i guess state the other s posit in a maximalist extrem way but i think there is a differ here this idea of nation build is kind of a pejor phrase but think about the great conflict of the past centuri world war ii dure the year between world war i and world war ii a great lesson was learn by our militari leader and the peopl of the unit state the lesson was that in the aftermath of world war i we kind of turn our back and left them to their own devic and they brew up a lot of troubl that quick becam world war ii and act upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victori in world war ii we laid down the marshal plan presid truman did we got intim involv in build nato and other structur there we still have lot of troop in europ and what did we do in the late 40 s and 50 s and 60 s we were nation build and it was econom but it was also militari and the confid that those countri recov from the wound of war had by have troop there we had civil administr come in to set up their way of build their town back
p3143
aVbush first let me just say one comment about what the vice presid said i think one of the lesson in between world war i and world war ii is we let our militari atrophi and we can t do that we ve got to rebuild our militari but one of the problem we have in the militari is we re in a lot of place around the world and i mention one and that s the balkan i would veri much like to get our troop out of there i recogn we can t do it now nor do i advoc an immedi withdraw that would be an abrog of our agreement with nato no one is suggest that but i think it ought to be one of our prioriti to work with our european friend to convinc them to put troop on the ground and there is an exampl haiti is anoth exampl now there are some place where i think you know i ve support the administr in columbia i think it s import for us to be train columbian in that part of the world the hemispher is in our interest to have a peac columbia but
p3144
aVbush i don t think so i think what we need to do is convinc peopl who live in the land they live in to build the nation mayb i m miss someth here i mean we re go to have kind of a nation build core from america absolut not our militari is meant to fight and win war that s what it s meant to do and when it get overextend moral drop i strong believ we need to have a militari presenc in the peninsula not onli to keep the peac in the peninsula but to keep region stabil and i strong believ we need to keep a presenc in nato but i m go to be judici as to how to use the militari it need to be in our vital interest the mission need to be clear and the extra strategi obvious
p3145
aVgore i don t disagre with that i certain don t disagre that we ought to get our troop home from place like the balkan as soon as we can as soon as the mission is complet that s what we did in haiti there are no more than a hand of american militari personnel in haiti now and haitian have their problem but we gave them a chanc to restor democraci that s realli about all we can do but if you have a situat like that right in our backyard with chao about to break out and flotilla form to come across the water and all kind of violenc there right in one of our neighbor countri there then i think that we did the right thing there and as for this idea of nation build the phrase sound grandios and you know we can t be we can t allow ourselv to get overextend i certain agre with that and that s whi i ve support build up our capac i ve devot in the budget i ve propos as i said last week more than twice as much as the governor has propos i think that it s in better shape now than he general doe we ve had some disagr about that he said that two divis would have to report not readi for duti and that s not what the joint chief say but there s no doubt that we have to continu build up readi and militari strength and we have to also be veri cautious in the way we use our militari
p3146
aVbush well i mention third world debt
p3147
aVbush that s a place where we can use our generos to influenc in a posit way influenc nation i believ we ought to have foreign aid but i don t think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid i think foreign aid need to be use to encourag market and reform i think a lot of time we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it end up be spent the wrong way and there s some pretti egregi exampl recent one be russia where we had imf loan that end up in the pocket of a lot of power peopl and didn t help the nation i think the imf has got a role in the world but i don t want to see the imf out there as a way to say to world banker if you make a bad loan we ll bail you out it need to be avail for emerg situat i thought the presid did the right thing with mexico and was veri strong support of the administr in mexico but i don t think the imf ought to be a stop loss for peopl who ought to be abl to evalu risk themselv so i ll look at everi place where we re invest money i just want to make sure the return is good
p3148
aVbush yes it doe take for exampl third world debt i think we ought to be forgiv third world debt under certain condit i think for exampl if we re convinc that a third world countri that s got a lot of debt would reform itself that the money wouldn t go into the hand of a few but would go to help peopl i think it make sens for us to use our wealth in that way or to trade debt for valuabl rain forest land make that much sens yes we do have an oblig but we can t be all thing to all peopl we can help build coalit but we can t put our troop all around the world we can lend money but we have to do it wise we shouldn t be lend money to corrupt offici so we have to be guard in our generos
p3149
aVgore no i would make some chang i think there need to be reform in the imf i ve general support it but i ve seen them make some call that i thought were high question and i think that there s a general agreement in mani part of the world now that there ought to be chang in the imf the world bank i think is general do a better job but i think one of the big issu here that doesn t get near enough attent is the issu of corrupt the governor mention it earlier i ve work on this issu it s an enorm problem and corrupt in offici agenc like militari and polic depart around the world custom offici that s one of the worst form of it and we have got to again lead by exampl and help these other countri that are tri to straighten out their situat find the tool in order to do it i just think jim that this is an absolut uniqu period in world histori the world has come togeth as i said they re look to us and we have a fundament choic to make are we go to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after world war ii the way that generat of hero said okay the unit state is go to be the leader and the world benefit tremend from the courag that they show in those post war year i think that in the aftermath of the cold war it s time for us to do someth veri similar to step up to the plate to provid the leadership on the environ leadership to make sure the world economi keep move in the right direct again that mean not run big deficit here and not squander our surplus it mean have intellig decis that keep our prosper go and shepherd that econom strength so that we can provid that leadership role
p3150
aVbush let me comment on that i m not so sure the role of the unit state is to go around the world and say this is the way it s got to be we can help and mayb it s just our differ in govern the way we view govern i want to empow the peopl i want to help peopl help themselv not have govern tell peopl what to do i just don t think it s the role of the unit state to walk into a countri and say we do it this way so should you i think we can help i know we ve got to encourag democraci in the marketplac but take russia for exampl we went into russia we said here is some imf money and it end up in viktor chemomyrdin s pocket and other and yet we play like there was reform the onli peopl that are go to reform russia are russia they re go to have to make the decis themselv mr putin is go to have to make the decis as to whether or not he want to adher to rule of law and normal account practic so that if countri and or entiti invest capit there s a reason rate of return a way to get the money out of the economi but russia has to make the decis we can work with them on secur matter for exampl but it s their call to make so i m not exact sure where the vice presid is come from but i think one way for us to end up be view as the ugli american is for us to go around the world say we do it this way so should you now we trust freedom we know freedom is a power power power forc much bigger than the unit state of america as we saw recent in the balkan but mayb i misunderstand where you re come from mr vice presid but i think the unit state must be humbl and must be proud and confid of our valu but humbl in how we treat nation that are figur out how to chart their own cours
p3151
aVgore far be it from me to suggest otherwis laughter
p3152
aVgore yes i would the onli thing an execut order can accomplish is to ban it in feder law enforc agenc but i would also support a law in the congress that would have the effect of do the same thing i just i think that racial profil is a serious problem i rememb when the stori first came out about the stop in new jersey by the highway patrol there and i know it s been go on a long time in some way this is just a new label for someth that has been go on for year but i have to confess that it was the first time that i realli focus on it in a new way and i was surpris at the extent of it and i think we ve now got so mani exampl around the countri that we realli have to find way to end this imagin what it what it is like for someon to be singl out unfair unjust and feel the unfair forc of law simpli becaus of race or ethnic now that run counter to what the unit state of america is all about at our core and it s not an easi problem to solv but if i am entrust with the presid it will be the first civil right act of the 21st centuri
p3153
aVbush yeah i can t imagin what it would be like to be singl out becaus of race and stop and harass that s just flat wrong and that s not what america is all about and so we ought to do everyth we can to end racial profil one of my concern though is i don t want to feder the local polic forc i want to obvious in the egregi case we need to enforc civil right law but we need to make sure that intern affair decis at the local level do their job and be given a chanc to do their job i believ in local control of govern and obvious if they don t there need to be a consequ at the feder level but it s veri import that we not overstep our bound and i think most peopl most polic offic are good dedic honor citizen who are do their job put their live at risk who aren t bigot or aren t prejud i don t think they ought to be held guilti but i do think we need to find out where racial profil occur and do someth about it and say to the local folk get it done and if you can t there will be a feder consequ
p3154
aVbush yeah
p3155
aVgore i would agre and i also agre that most polic offic of cours are do a good job and hate this practic also i talk to an african american polic offic in springfield massachusett not long ago who rais this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solut is in the train and not onli the train in polic procedur but human relat and i think that racial profil is part of a larger issu of how we deal with race in america and as for singl peopl out becaus of race you know jame byrd was singl out becaus of his race in texa and other american have been singl out becaus of their race or ethnic and that s whi i think we can embodi our valu by pass a hate crime law i think these crime are differ i think they re differ becaus they re base on prejudic and hatr which give rise to crime that have not just a singl victim but they re intend to stigmat and dehuman a whole group of peopl
p3156
aVbush no i don t realli
p3157
aVbush no we ve got one in texa and guess what the three men who murder jame byrd guess what s go to happen to them they re go to be put to death a juri found them guilti it s go to be hard to punish them ani wors after they get put to death and it s the right caus it s the right decis second there is other form of racial profil that goe on in america arab american are racial profil in what is call secret evid peopl are stop and we have to do someth about that my friend senat spencer abraham of michigan is push a law to make sure that arab american are treat with respect so racial profil isn t just an issu at local polic forc it s an issu throughout our societi and as we becom a divers societi we re go to have to deal with it more and more i believ though i believ as sure as i m sit here that most american realli care they re toler peopl they re good toler peopl it s the veri few that creat most of the crise and we just have to find them and deal with them
p3158
aVbush let me tell you where the biggest discrimin come in public educ when we just move children through the school my friend phylli hunter is here she had one of the greatest line of all line she said read is the new civil right she s right and to make sure our societi is as hope as it possibl can be everi singl child in america must be educ i mean everi child it start with make sure everi child learn to read k 2 diagnost test so we know whether or not there s a defici curriculum that work and phonic need to be an integr part of our read curriculum intens read laboratori teacher retrain i mean there need to be a wholesal effort against racial profil which is illiter children we can do better in our public school we can close an achiev gap and it start with make sure we have strong account jim one of the cornerston of reform and good reform is to measur becaus when you measur you can ask the question do they know is anybodi be profil is anybodi be discrimin against it becom a tool a correct tool and i believ the feder govern must say that if you receiv ani money ani money from the feder govern for disadvantag children for exampl you must show us whether or not the children are learn and if they are fine and if they re not there has to be a consequ and so to make sure we end up get rid of basic structur prejudic is educ there is noth more prejud than not educ a child
p3159
aVgore well i think we need tough enforc of the civil right law i think we still need affirm action i would pass a hate crime law as i said and i guess i had misunderstood the governor s previous posit the byrd famili may have a misunderstand of it in texa also but i would like to shift if i could to the big issu of educ
p3160
aVgore i m glad you clarifi that
p3161
aVgore well it was not one of my ad either governor but i am familiar with the statement and it was made by one of the top rank offici of that organ let me tell you my posit i think that some common sens gun safeti measur are certain need with the flood of cheap handgun that have sometim been work their way into the hand of the wrong peopl but all of my propos are focus on that problem gun safeti none of my propos would have ani effect on hunter or sportsmen or peopl who use rifl they re aim at the real problem let s make our school safe let s make our neighborhood safe let s have a three day wait period cool off so we can have a background check to make sure that crimin and peopl who realli shouldn t have gun don t get them but i would like to use my remain time on this exchang jim to respond to an exchang that took place just a moment ago becaus a coupl of time the governor has said that i am for a bigger govern governor i m not and let me tell you what the record show for the last eight year i have had the challeng of run the streamlin program call reinvent govern and if there are ani feder employe in this group you know what that mean the feder govern has been reduc in size by more than 300 000 peopl and it s now the smallest number that we have had sinc the the smallest in size sinc john kennedi s administr dure the last five year texa s govern has gone up in size feder govern has gone down texa s govern has gone up now my plan for the futur i see a time when we have smaller smarter govern where you don t have to wait in line becaus you can get servic onlin cheaper better faster we can do that
p3162
aVgore we ve got a bumper crop this year but that s the good news you know what the bad news is that follow on that the price are low in the last sever year the so call freedom to farm law has in my view been most a failur i want to chang mani of it provis now mani here who are not involv in farm don t won t follow this so just forgiv me becaus the 2 of the countri that is involv in farm is import becaus the rest of us wouldn t eat except for them and you guy have been have a hard time and i want to fight for you i want to chang those provis i want to restor a meaning safeti net and i think that you point the way in your comment becaus when you say there are multipl thing accomplish by farmer you re specif includ conserv and protect of the environ and yes farmer are the first environmentalist and when they decid not to plow a field that is vulner to soil eros that may cost them a littl money but it help the environ i think that we ought to have an expand conserv reserv program and i think that the environment benefit that come from sound manag of the land ought to repres a new way for farmer to get some incom that will enabl them enabl you to make sensibl choic in crop rotat and when you leav the land fallow and the rest now i ll go beyond that and say i think we need much more focus on rural econom develop program i see a time when the internet base activ are more avail in the rural area and where the extra sourc of incom that farm famili use to have from shoe factori is replac by an extra sourc of incom from work in the inform economi so we need to do a lot of thing but we ought to start with a better safeti net
p3163
aVbush i would like our farmer feed the world we re the best produc in the world and i want i want the farmer feed the world we need to open up market export are down and everi time an export number goe down it hurt the farmer i want the next presid to have fast track negoti author to open up market around the world with the best and the most effici farmer i don t want to use food as a diplomat weapon from this point forward we shouldn t be use food it hurt the farmer it s not the right thing to do i m for valu ad process we need more work on valu ad process you take the raw product you produc i presum you re a farmer off your farm and you convert it valu ad process is import i m for research and develop spend research and develop money so that we can use our technolog base to figur out new use for farm product i m for get rid of the death tax complet get rid of the death tax one reason famili farmer are forc to sell earli is becaus of the death tax this is a bad tax the presid shouldn t have veto that bill it s a tax that tax peopl twice it penal the famili farmer so should i be fortun enough to earn your vote i also understand i want to open up market but i also understand that farm is a part of our nation secur i m from a big farm state we re the second biggest state farm state in the countri and i hear from my farmer and friend all the time the vice presid is right by the way everi day is earth day if you own the land i like the polici that will encourag farmer to put set asid land as well for conserv purpos thank you
p3164
aVgore yeah i m for a massiv reform of the estat tax or the death tax and under the plan that i ve propos 80 of all famili farm will be complet exempt from the estat tax and the vast major of all famili busi would be complet exempt and all of the other would have sharpli reduc so 80 now the problem with complet elimin it goe back to the wealthiest 1 the amount of money that has to be rais in tax for middl class famili to make up for complet elimin that on the veri wealthiest the billionair that would be an extra heavi burden on middl class famili and so let s do it for most all but not complet elimin it for the veri top
p3165
aVbush elimin the death tax
p3166
aVgore and i specif would like to know whether governor bush will support the dingl norwood bill which is the main one pend
p3167
aVbush becaus peopl shouldn t be tax twice on their asset it s either unfair for some or unfair for all again this is just a differ of opinion if you re from washington you want to pick and choos winner i don t think that s the role of the presid i think if you re go to have tax relief everybodi benefit second i think your plan a lot of fine print in your plan mr vice presid with all due respect it is i m not so sure 80 of the peopl get the death tax i know this 100 will get it if i m the presid i just don t think it s fair to tax peopl s asset twice regardless of your status it s a fair issu it s an issu of principl not polit
p3168
aVbush hi joyc

p3174
aVbush tell you what i hear a lot of peopl are sick and tire of the bitter in washington d c and therefor they don t want ani part of polit they look at washington and see peopl point finger and cast blame and say one thing and do anoth there s a lot of young folk say you know whi do i want to be involv with this mess and what i think need to happen in order to encourag the young to becom involv is to shoot straight is to set asid the partisan differ and set an agenda that will make sens medicar i know you talk about it but medicar is relev for all of us young and old alik we better get it right now tax reform is relev for old and young alik i don t think it s the issu that turn kid off i think it s the tone i think it s the attitud i think it s a cynic in washington and it doesn t have to be that way befor i decid to run i had to resolv two issu in my mind one could our famili endur all this busi and i came to the conclus that our love was strong enough to be abl to do it the other was could an administr chang the tone in washington d c and i believ the answer is yes otherwis i wouldn t be ask for your vote that s what happen in texa we work togeth there is a man here in this audienc name hugo berlanga he is the chairman of the health committe he came here for a reason to tout our record on health in texa he s a democrat i didn t care whether he was a republican or democrat what i care about is could we work togeth that s what washington d c need and final sir to answer your question you need somebodi in offic who will tell the truth that s the best way to get peopl back in the system
p3175
aVbush hi norma
p3176
aVbush i ve had a record of bring peopl from all walk of life into my administr and my administr is better off for it in texa i m go to find peopl that want to serv their countri but i want a divers administr i think it s import i ve work hard in the state of texa to make sure our institut reflect the state with good smart polici polici that reject quota i don t like quota quota tend to pit one group of peopl against anoth quota are bad for america it s not the way america is all about but polici that give peopl a help hand so they can help themselv for exampl in our state of texa i work with the legislatur both republican and democrat to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10 of your high school class you re automat admit to one of our higher institut of learn colleg and as a result our univers are now more divers it was a smart thing to do what i call it i label it affirm access i think the contract busi in govern can help not with quota but help meet a goal of ownership of small busi for exampl the contract need to be smaller the agenc need to be need to recruit and to work hard to find peopl to bid on the state contract i think we can do that in a way that repres what america is all about which is equal opportun and an opportun for peopl to realiz their potenti so to answer your question i support i guess the way to put it is affirm access i ll have an administr that will make you proud thank you
p3177
aVbush well the differ is is that i can get it done that i can get someth posit done on behalf of the peopl that s what the question in this campaign is about it s not onli what s your philosophi and what s your posit on issu but can you get thing done and i believ i can

aVgore i believ in this goal and effort with all my heart i believ that our futur as a nation depend upon whether or not we can break down these barrier that have been use to pit group against group and bring our peopl togeth how do you do it well you establish respect for differ you don t ignor differ it s all too easi for somebodi in the major in the popul to say oh we re just all the same without an understand of the differ life experi that you ve had that other have had onc you have that understand and mutual respect then we can transcend the differ and embrac the highest common denomin of the american spirit i don t know what affirm access mean i do know what affirm action mean i know the governor is against it and i know that i m for it i know what a hate crime statut pend at the nation level is all about in the aftermath of jame byrd s death i m for that propos law the governor is against it i know what it mean to have a commit to divers i am part of an administr that has the finest record on divers and incident an excel i mean i think our success over the last eight year has not been in spite of divers but becaus of it becaus we re abl to draw on the wisdom and experi from differ part of the societi that hadn t been tap in the same way befor and incident mel carnahan in missouri had the finest record on divers in ani governor in the entir histori of the state of missouri and i want to honor that among his other achiev here now i just believ that what we have to do is enforc the civil right law i m against quota this is with all due respect governor that s a red herring affirm action isn t quota i m against quota they re illeg they re against the american way affirm action mean that you take extra step to acknowledg the histori of discrimin and injustic and prejudic and bring all peopl into the american dream becaus it help everybodi not just those who are direct benefit
p3179
aVbush if affirm action mean quota i m against it if affirm action mean what i just describ what i m for then i m for it you heard what i was for the vice presid keep say i m against thing you heard what i was for and that s what i support
p3180
aVgore he said if affirm action mean quota he s against it affirm action doesn t mean quota are you for it without quota
p3181
aVbush i may not be for your version mr vice presid but i m for what i just describ to the ladi
p3182
aVgore are you for what the suprem court say is a constitut way of have affirm action
p3183
aVgore i think that speak for itself
p3184
aVbush no it doesn t speak for itself mr vice presid it speak for the fact that there are certain rule in this that we all agre to but evid rule don t mean anyth
p3185
aVgore what about the dingl norwood bill
p3186
aVgore if you make less than 60 000 a year and you decid to invest 1 000 in a save account you ll get a tax credit which mean in essenc that the feder govern will match your 1 000 with anoth 1 000 if you make less than 30 000 a year and you put 500 in a save account the feder govern will match it with 1500 if you make more than 60 000 and up to 100 you ll still get a match but not as generous you ll get an access to life long learn and educ help with tuition if you want to get a new skill or train if you want to purchas health insur you will get help with that if you want to particip in some of the dynam chang that are go on in our countri you will get specif help in do that if you are part of the of the bottom 20 or so of wage earner then you will get an expand earn incom tax credit now the tax relief that i propos is direct specif at middl incom individu and famili and if you have a if you have an elder parent or grandpar who need long term care then you will get help with that 3 000 tax credit to help your expens in take care of a love one who need long term care
p3187
aVbush let me just say the first this busi about the entitl he tri to describ about save you know match save here and match save there fulli fund it s gonna cost a whole lot of money a lot more than we have you re go to get a tax refund in my plan you re not go to be target in or target out everybodi that pay tax is go to get tax relief if you take care of an elder in your home you re go to get the person exempt increas i think also what you need to think about is not the immedi but what about medicar you get a plan that will includ prescript drug a plan that will give you option now i hope peopl understand that medicar today is import but it doesn t keep up with the new medicin if you re a medicar person on medicar you don t get the new procedur you re stuck in a time warp in mani way so it will be a modern medicar system that trust you to make a varieti of option for you you re go to live in a peac world it will be a world of peac becaus we re go to have a clear sight of foreign polici base upon a strong militari and a mission that stand by our friend a mission that doesn t tri to be all thing to all peopl a judici use of the militari which will help keep the peac you ll live in a world hope that is more educ so it s less like you ll be harm in your neighborhood see an educ child is one much more like to be hope and optimist you ll be in a world in which fit into my philosophi the harder you work the more you can keep it s the american way govern shouldn t be a heavi hand it s what the feder govern doe to you it should be a help hand and tax relief and the propos i just describ should be a good help hand
p3188
aVbush no i m not proud of that the death penalti is a veri serious busi leo it s an issu that good peopl obvious disagre on i take my job serious and if you think i was proud of it i think you misread me i do i was sworn to uphold the law of my state dure the cours of the campaign in 1994 i was ask do you support the death penalti i said i did if administ fair and just becaus i believ it save live leo i do if it s administ swift just and fair it save live one of the thing that happen when you re a governor at least oftentim you have to make tough decis you can t let public persuas sway you becaus the job is to enforc the law and that s what i did sir there have been some tough case come across my desk some of the hardest moment sinc i ve been the governor of the state of texa is to deal with those case but my job is to ask two question sir is the person guilti of the crime and did the person have full access to the court of law and i can tell you look at you right now in all case those answer were affirm i m not proud of ani record i m proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the state of texa i m proud of the fact that we hold peopl account but i m not proud of ani record sir i m not
p3189
aVgore i support the death penalti i think that it has to be administ not onli fair with attent to thing like dna evid which i think should be use in all capit case but also with veri care attent if for exampl somebodi confess to the crime and somebodi is wait on death row there has to be alert to say wait a minut have we got the wrong guy if the wrong guy is put to death then that s a doubl tragedi not onli has an innoc person been execut but the real perpetr of the crime has not been held account for it and in some case may be still at larg but i support the death penalti in the most heinous case
p3190
aVbush i do it s the onli reason to be for it let me finish sir i don t think you should support the death penalti to seek reveng i don t think that s right i think the reason to support the death penalti is becaus it save other peopl s live
p3191
aVgore i think it is a deterr i know that s a controversi view but i do believ it s a deterr
p3192
aVgore yes laughter i am a person who keep promis and you know we ve heard a lot about from the governor about not much be done in the last eight year as if the promis that i made eight year ago have not been kept i think the record show otherwis we have gone from the biggest deficit eight year ago to the biggest surplus in histori today instead of high unemploy we now have the lowest african american unemploy the lowest latino unemploy ever measur 22 million new job veri low unemploy nation instead of balloon the debt and multipli it four time over we have seen the debt actual begun to be paid down here are some promis that i ll make to you now i will balanc the budget everi year i will pay down the debt everi year i will give middl class american tax cut meaning one and i will invest in educ health care protect the environ and retir secur we both made promis in this campaign i promis you i will keep mine let me tell you about one of the governor s he has promis a trillion dollar out of the social secur trust fund for young work adult to invest and save on their own but he s promis senior that their social secur benefit will not be cut and he s promis the same trillion dollar to them so this is a show me state remind me of the line from the movi show me the money which one of those promis will be keep and which will you break governor
p3193
aVbush thank you for your question laughter i there s an old high school debat trick which is to answer someth and then attack your oppon at the end you ask about promis you were promis that medicar would be reform and that social secur would be reform you were promis a middl class tax cut in 1992 it didn t happen there s too much bitter in washington there s too much wrangl it s time to have a fresh start one of the reason i was success as the governor of texa is becaus i didn t tri to be all thing to all peopl when i campaign in a race a lot of folk didn t think i could win includ by the way my mother laughter i said i d do four thing tort reform educ reform welfar reform and juvenil justic reform and i won and i had the will of the peopl in my state behind me and then i brought folk togeth to get it done and that s what we need i think in this elect to me that s what it s all about i m sure your 6th grade kid are listen and say these guy will say anyth to get elect but there s a record and that s what i hope peopl look at one of my promis is go to be social secur reform and you bet we need to take a trillion dollar out of that 2 4 trillion surplus now rememb social secur revenu exceed expens up until 2015 peopl are go to get paid but if you re a younger worker if you re younger you better hope this countri think differ otherwis you re gonna be face with huge payrol tax or reduc benefit and you bet we re gonna take a trillion dollar of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelin so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltri 2 that the feder govern get for you today that s one of my promis but it s gonna requir peopl to bring both republican and democrat togeth to get it done that s what it requir there was a chanc to get this done it was a bipartisan approach but it s been reject i m go to bring them togeth
p3194
aVgore well first of all jim i would like to respond to what the governor just said becaus the trillion dollar that has been promis to young peopl has also been promis to older peopl and you cannot keep both promis if you re in your mid 40 s under the governor s plan social secur will be bankrupt by the time you retir if he take it out of the social secur trust fund under my plan it will be it solvenc will be extend until you re 100 now that is the differ and the governor may not want to answer that question he may want to call it a high school debat trick but let me tell you this this elect is not about debat trick it is about your futur the reason social secur he say it get 2 you know it s not a bank account that just pay back money that s invest it is also use to give your mother and father the social secur check that they live on if you take a trillion dollar out of that social secur trust fund how are the check go to be how are you go to keep faith with the senior now let me come direct to your question
p3195
aVbush i m not quit through let me finish i talk about the principl and the issu that i think are import in a patient s bill of right it s kind of washington d c focus well it s in this committe or it s got this sponsor if i m the presid we re go to have emerg room care we re go have gag order we re go to have direct access to ob gyn peopl will be abl to take their hmo insur compani to court that s what i ve done in texa and that s the kind of leadership style i ll bring to washington
p3196
aVbush well can i answer that one reason peopl are skeptic is becaus peopl don t answer the question they ve been ask the trillion dollar come out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money there s just a differ of opinion i want worker to have their own asset it s who you trust govern or peopl
p3197
aVgore thank you veri much jim and i ll begin by answer your question your last question i believ that a lot of peopl are skeptic about peopl in polit today becaus we have seen a time of great challeng for our countri sinc the assassin of our best leader in the 60 s sinc the vietnam war sinc waterg and becaus we need campaign financ reform i would like to tell you someth about me i keep my word i have kept the faith i ve kept the faith with my countri i volunt for the armi i serv in vietnam i kept the faith with my famili tipper and i have been marri for 30 year we have devot ourselv to our children and now our near one and a half year old grandson i have kept the faith with our countri nine time i have rais my hand to take an oath to the constitut and i have never violat that oath i have not spent the last quarter centuri in pursuit of person wealth i have spent the last quarter centuri fight for middl class work men and women in the unit state of america i believ veri deepli that you have to be will to stand up and fight no matter what power forc might be on the other side if you want somebodi who is will to fight for you i am ask for your support and your vote and yes your confid and your willing to believ that we can do the right thing in america and be the better for it we ve made some progress dure the last eight year we have seen the strongest economi in the histori of the unit state lower crime rate for eight year in a row highest privat home ownership ever but i ll make you one promis here you ain t seen noth yet and i will keep that promis
p3198
aVbush well jim i want to thank you and thank the folk here at washington univers and the vice presid appreci the chanc to have a good honest dialogu about our differ of opinion i think after three debat the good peopl of this countri understand there is a differ of opinion there is a differ between big feder govern and somebodi who is come from outsid of washington who will trust individu i ve got an agenda that i want to get done for the countri it s an agenda that say we re go to reform medicar to make sure senior have got prescript drug and to give senior differ option from which they can choos it s an agenda that say we re listen to the young voic in social secur and say we re go to think differ about make sure we have a system but also fulfil the promis to the senior in america a promis made will be a promis kept should i be fortun enough to becom your presid i want to have the militari keep the peac i want to make sure the public school system in america keep it promis so not one child is left behind after set prioriti i want to give some of your money back i don t think the surplus is the govern s money i think it s the peopl s money i don t think it exist becaus of the ingenu and hard work of the feder govern i think in exist becaus of the ingenu and hard work of the american peopl and you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build i look forward to the final week of this campaign i m ask for your vote for those of you for me thank for your help for those of you for my oppon pleas onli vote onc laughter but for those who have not made up their mind i would like to conclud by this promis should i be fortun enough to becom your presid when i put my hand on the bibl i will swear to not onli uphold the law of the land but i will also swear to uphold the honor and the digniti of the offic to which i have been elect so help me god thank you veri much
p3199
aVbush well that s a great question i think one of the problem we have particular for senior is there is no prescript drug coverag in medicar and therefor when they have to tri to purchas drug they do so on their own there s no kind of collect bargain no power of purchas among senior so i think step one to make sure prescript drug is more afford for senior and those are the folk who realli reli upon prescript drug a lot these day is to reform the medicar system is to have precipit drug as an integr part of medicar onc and for all the problem we have today is like the patient s bill of right particular with health care there s a lot of bicker in washington d c it s kind of like a polit issu as oppos to a peopl issu so what i want to do is i want to call upon republican and democrat to forget all the argu and finger point and come togeth and take care of our senior prescript drug program that say we ll pay for the poor senior we ll help all senior with prescript drug in the meantim i think it s import to have what s call immedi help hand which is direct money to state so that senior poor senior don t have to choos between food and medicin that s part of an overal overhaul the purchas power and i m against price control i think price control would hurt our abil to continu import research and develop drug therapi are replac a lot of medicin as we use to know it one of the most import thing is to continu the research and develop compon and so i m against price control expedit drug through the fda make sens of cours allow the new bill that was pass in the congress made sens to allow for you know drug that were sold oversea to come back and other countri to come back into the unit state that make sens but the best thing to do is to reform medicar
p3200
aVgore all right here we go again now look if you want someon who will spend a lot of word describ a whole convolut process and then end up support legisl that is support by the big drug compani this is your man if you want someon who will fight for you and who will fight for the middl class famili and work men and women who are sick and tire of have their parent and grandpar pay higher price for prescript drug than anybodi els then i want to fight them and you ask a great question becaus it s not onli senior listen for 24 year i have never been afraid to take on the big drug compani they do some great thing they discov great new cure and that s great we want them to continu that but they are now spend more money on advertis and promot you see all these ad than they are on research and develop and they are tri artifici extend the monopoli patent protect so they can keep charg these veri high price i want to streamlin the approv of the compet generic drug and the new kind of treatment that can compet with them so we bring the price down for everybodi now briefli let me tell you how my prescript drug plan work the governor talk about medicar i propos a real prescript drug benefit under medicar for all senior all senior and here s how it work you pick your own doctor and nobodi can take that away from you the doctor choos the prescript that you need and nobodi can overrul your doctor you go to your own pharmaci and then medicar pay half the price if you re poor they pay all of it if you have extraordinarili high cost then they pay all over 4 000 out of pocket and i ll bring new competit to bring the price down and if you pass the big drug compani bill noth will happen
p3201
aVgore i think that we should move step by step toward univers health coverag but i am not in favor of govern do it all we ve spent 65 year now on the develop of a hybrid system part privat part public and 85 of our peopl have health insur 15 don t that add up to 44 million peopl that is a nation outrag we have got to get health coverag for those who do not have it and we ve got to improv the qualiti for those who do with a patient s bill of right that s real and that work the dingl norwood bill and we have got to fill in the gap in coverag by final bring pariti for the treatment of mental ill becaus that s been left out we have got to deal with long term care now here are the step that i would take first of all i will make a commit to bring health care coverag of high qualiti that is afford to everi singl child in america within four year and then we ll fill other gap by cover the parent of those children when the famili is poor or up to two and a half time the poverti rate i want to give a tax credit for the purchas of individu health insur plan i want to give small busi employ a tax credit 25 to encourag the provid of health insur for the employe in small busi i want to give senior who are well the near elder i don t like that term becaus i am just about in that categori but those 55 to 65 ought to be abl to buy into medicar for premium that are reason and fair and signific below what they have to get now now we have a big differ on this and you need to know the record here under governor bush texa has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care in health insur for their citizen last week he said that they were spend 3 7 billion dollar or 4 7 billion dollar on this
p3202
aVgore okay
p3203
aVbush i m absolut oppos to a nation health care plan i don t want the feder govern make decis for consum or for provid i rememb what the administr tri to do in 1993 they tri to have a nation health care plan and fortun it fail i trust peopl i don t trust the feder govern it s go to be one of the theme you hear tonight i don t want the feder govern make decis on behalf of everybodi there is an issu with the uninsur there sure is and we have uninsur peopl in my state our is a big state a fast grow state we share a common border with anoth nation but we re provid health care for our peopl one thing about insur that s a washington term the question is are peopl get health care and we have a strong safeti net and there need to be a safeti net in america there need to be more communiti health clinic where the poor can go get health care we need a program for the uninsur they ve been talk about it in washington d c the number of uninsur has now gone up for the past seven year we need a 2 000 credit rebat for peopl work peopl that don t have insur they can get in the marketplac and start purchas insur we need to have allow small busi to write insur across jurisdict line so small busi can afford health care small restaur can afford health care so health care need to be afford and avail we have to trust peopl to make decis with their live in the medicar reform i talk about it say if you are a senior you can stay in medicar if you like it and that s fine but we re go to give you other choic to choos if you want to do so just like they do the feder employe the peopl that work in washington d c for the u s congress or the unit state senat get a varieti of choic to make in their live and that s what we ought to do for all peopl in america
p3204
aVgore mr hankin i don t feel good about it and i think we ought to have a patient s bill of right to take the medic decis away from the hmos and give them back to the doctor and nurs i want to come back and tell you whi but if you will forgiv me i would like to say someth right now at the begin of this debat follow on the moment of silenc for mel carnahan and randi carnahan and chris sifford tipper and i were good friend with mel and randi and i know that all of us here want to extend our sympathi and condol to jean and the famili and to the sifford famili and i would just like to say that this debat in a way is a live tribut to mel carnahan becaus he love the vigor discuss of idea in our democraci he was a fantast governor of missouri this state becam one of the top five in the nation for health care coverag for children under his leadership one of the best in advanc all kind of benefit for children to grow up healthi and strong and of cours this debat also take place at a time when the tragedi of the uss cole is on our mind and heart and insofar as the memori servic tomorrow i would like to also extend sympathi to the famili of those who have die and those who are still miss and the injur now mr hankin i think that the situat that you describ has gotten complet out of hand doctor are give prescript they re recommend treatment and then their recommend are be overrul by hmos and insur compani that is unaccept i support a strong nation patient s bill of right it is actual a disagr between us a nation law that is pend on this the dingl norwood bill a bipartisan bill is one that i support and that the governor doe not
p3205
aVgore follow up
p3206
aVbush well you know it s hard to make peopl love one anoth i wish i knew the law becaus i would darn sure sign it i wish i knew the law that said all of us would be good parent one of the thing the next presid must do is to remind peopl that if we are go to have a respons period in america that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul i happen to believ strong account encourag parent involv though i think when you measur and post result on the internet or in the town newspap most parent say wait a minut my child s school isn t do what i want it to do and therefor becom involv in educ i recogn there are some who just don t seem to care but there are a lot of parent who feel like everyth is go well in their child s school and all of a sudden they wake up and realiz that wait a minut standard aren t be met that s whi i m so strong for account i believ we ought to measur a lot three four five six seven eighth grade we do so in my state of texa one of the good thing we ve gone in texa is we have strong account becaus you can t cure unless you know you can t solv a problem unless you diagnos it i strong believ that one of the best thing to encourag parent involv also is to know that the classroom will be safe and secur that s whi i support a teacher liabil act at the feder level that say if a teacher or princip uphold reason standard of classroom disciplin they can t be su they can t be su i think parent will be more involv with educ when they know their children s classroom are safe and secur as well i also believ that we need to say to peopl that if you cannot meet standard there has to be a consequ instead of just come the soft bigotri of low expect that there has to be a consequ we can t continu to shuffl children through school and one of the consequ to allow parent to have differ choic
p3207
aVgore we have huge differ between us on this question i d like to start by tell you what my vision is i see a day in the unit state of america where all of our public school are consid excel world class where there are no fail school where the classroom are small enough in size number of student so that the teacher can spend enough one on one time with each student now that mean recruit new teacher for the public school it mean in my plan hire bonus to get 100 000 new teacher in the public school within the next four year it mean also help local school district that sometim find the parent of school age children outvot on bond issu to give them some help with interest free bond author so that we can build new school and modern the classroom we need to give teacher the train and profession develop that they need includ a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skill i want to give everi middl class famili a 10 000 a year tax deduct for colleg tuition so that middl class famili will alway be abl to send their kid on to colleg i want to work for univers free school becaus we know from all the studi that the youngster learn kid learn more in the first few year of life than ani where els now i said there was a contrast governor bush is for voucher and in his plan he propos to drain more money more taxpay money out of the public school for privat school voucher than all of the money that he propos in his entir budget for public school themselv and onli one in 20 student would be elig for these voucher and they wouldn t even pay the full tuition to privat school i think that s a mistak i don t think we should give up on the privat school and leav kid trap in fail school i think we i think we should make it the number one prioriti to make our school the best in the world all of them
p3208
aVbush yeah i appreci that i think ani time we end with one of these attack it s appropri to respond here s what i think first of all voucher are up to state if you want to do a voucher program in missouri fine i strong believ in local control of school i m a governor of state and i don t like it when the feder govern tell us what to do i believ in local control of school but here s what i said i ve said to the extent we send feder money on disadvantag children we want the school to show us whether or not the children are learn what s unreason about that we expect there to be standard met and we expect there to be measur and if we find success we ll prais it but when we find children trap in school that will not chang and will not teach instead of say oh this is okay in america just to shuffl poor kid through school there has to be a consequ and the consequ is that feder portion or feder money will go to the parent so the parent can go to a tutor program or anoth public school or anoth privat school you see there has to be a consequ we ve got a societi that say hey the status quo is fine just move them through and guess who suffer
p3209
aVgore well the program that he s propos is not the one that he just describ under your plan governor bush state would be requir to pay voucher to student to match the voucher so that the feder govern would put up now you re and the way it would happen is that under his plan if a school was design as fail the kid would be trap there for anoth three year and then some of them would get feder voucher and the state would be forc to match those that money under my plan if a school is fail we work with the state to give them the author and the resourc to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new princip a new faculti a turn around team of specialist who know what they re do it s base on the plan of governor jim hunt in north carolina and it work great
p3210
aVgore if i thought that there was no altern then i might feel differ but i have an oblig to fight to make sure there are no fail school we have to turn around most school are excel but we have to make sure that all of them are
p3211
aVgore what grade do you teach
p3212
aVgore high school i mention befor that the local communiti are have a harder time pass bond issu tradit if you ve been involv in a campaign like that you know that the parent with kid in school are the one that turn out and vote it s iron that there are now there is now a smaller percentag of the voter made up of parent with children than ever in american histori becaus of the age of our popul but at the same time we ve got the largest generat of student in public school ever more than 90 of america s children go to public school and it s the largest number ever this year and they ll break the record next year and everi year for ten year run we ve got to do someth about this and local it s not enough to leav it up to the local school district they re not abl to do it and our futur depend upon it look we re in an inform age our econom futur depend upon whether or not our children are go to get the kind of educ that let them go on to colleg and again i want to make it possibl for all middl class famili to send their kid to colleg and more pell grant for those who are in the lower incom group also and then i want to make sure that we have job train on top of that and lifelong learn but it all start with the public school teacher my propos give 10 000 hire bonus for those teacher who are who get certifi to teach in the area where they re most need now account we basic agre on account my plan requir test of all student it also requir someth that governor bush s plan doesn t it requir test of all new teacher includ in the subject that they teach we have to start treat teacher like the profession that they are and give them the respect and the kind of qualiti of life that will draw more peopl into teach becaus we need a lot more teacher
p3213

p3215
aVgore absolut not absolut not i m so glad that i have the chanc to knock that down look the problem is that under governor bush s plan 1 6 trillion tax cut most to the wealthi under his own budget number he propos spend more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1 than all the new money he budget for educ health care and nation defens combin now under my plan we ll balanc the budget everi year i m not just say this i m not just talk i have help to balanc the budget for the first time in 30 year paid down the debt and under my plan in four year as the percentag of our gross domest product feder spend will be the smallest that it has been in 50 year one reason is you know the third biggest spend item in our budget is interest on the nation debt we get noth for it we keep the good faith and credit of the unit state i will pay down the debt everi singl year until it is elimin earli in the next decad that get rid of the third biggest intrus of the feder govern in our economi now becaus the governor has all this money for a tax cut most to the wealthi there is no money left over so school get test and lawsuit reform and not much els
p3216
aVbush well he s wrong laughter just add up all the number it s three time bigger than what presid clinton propos the senat budget committe
p3217
aVgore that was in an ad jim that was knock down by the journalist who analyz the ad and said it was mislead
p3218
aVbush my turn
p3219
aVbush forget the journalist he propos more than walter mondal and michael dukaki combin this is a big spender and you ought to be proud of it it s part of his record we just have a differ philosophi let me talk about tax relief if you pay tax you ought to get tax relief the vice presid believ onli the right peopl ought to get tax relief i don t think that s the role of the presid to pick you re right and you re not right i think if you re go to have tax relief everybodi ought to get it and therefor wealthi peopl are go to get it but the top 1 will end up pay one third of the tax in america and they get one fifth of the benefit and that s becaus we structur the plan so that six million addit american famili pay no tax if you re a famili of four make 50 000 in missouri you get a 50 cut in your feder incom tax what i ve done is set prioriti and fund them and there s extra money and i believ the peopl who pay the bill ought to get some money back it s a differ of opinion he want to grow the govern and i trust you with your own money i wish we could spend an hour talk about trust peopl it s just the right posit to take
p3220
aVgore can we take the time
p3221
aVbush of cours it doe if you pay tax you are go to get a benefit peopl who pay tax will get tax relief
p3222
aVbush let me finish under my plan if you make the top the wealthi peopl pay 62 of the tax today afterward they pay 64 this is a fair plan you know whi becaus the tax code is unfair for peopl at the bottom end of the econom ladder if you re a singl mother make 22 000 a year today and you re tri to rais two children for everi addit dollar you earn you pay a higher margin rate on that dollar than someon make 200 000 and that s not right so i want to do someth about that
p3223
aVgore yeah look look this isn t about governor bush it s not about me it is about you and i want to come back to someth i said befor if you want somebodi who believ that we were better off eight year ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of polici that we had back then emphas tax cut main for the wealthi here is your man if you want somebodi who will fight for you and who will fight to have middl class tax cut then i am your man i want to be now i doubt anybodi here make more than 330 000 a year i won t ask you but if you do you re in the top 1
p3224
aVgore i m not go to ask them but if everyon here in this audienc was dead on in the middl of the middl class then the tax cut for everi singl one of you all ad up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1 now you judg for yourselv whether or not that s fair
p3225
aVbush good 50 million american get no tax relief under his plan
p3226
aVgore that s not right
p3227
aVgore jim we have a direct disagr on this
p3228
aVbush you may not be one of them you re just not one of the right peopl and second we ve had enough fight it s time to unit you talk about eight year in eight year they haven t gotten anyth done on medicar on social secur a patient s bill of right it s time to get someth done
p3229
aVgore hey i ve got to answer that jim
p3230
aVgore medicar i cast the tie break vote to add 26 year to the life of medicar it was due to go bankrupt in 1999 and that 50 million figur again the newspap i said you said forget the journalist but they are the keeper of the score card and whether or not you re use fact that aren t right and that fact is just not right
p3231
aVbush i ve been a leader i ve been a person who has to set a clear vision and convinc peopl to follow i ve got a strategi for the middl east and first let me say that our nation now need to speak with one voic dure this time and i applaud the presid for work hard to diffus tension our nation need to be credibl and strong when we say we re somebodi s friend everybodi has got to believ it israel is our friend and we ll stand by israel we need to reach out to modern arab nation as well to build coalit to keep the peac i also need the next leader need to be patient we can t put the middl east peac process on our timet it s got to be on the timet of the peopl that we re tri to bring to the peac tabl we can t dictat the term of peac which mean that you have to be steadi you can t worri about poll or focus group you ve got to have a clear vision that s what a leader doe a leader also understand that the unit state must be strong to keep the peac saddam hussein still is a threat in the middl east our coalit against saddam is unravel sanction are loosen the man who may be develop weapon of mass destruct we don t know becaus inspector aren t in so to answer your question it requir a clear vision a willing to stand by our friend and the credibl for peopl both friend and foe to understand when america say someth we mean it
p3232
aVgore i see a futur when the world is at peac with the unit state of america promot the valu of democraci and human right and freedom all around the world even in iran they have had an elect that began to bring about some chang we stand for those valu and we have to be will to assert them right now our militari is the strongest in the entir histori of the world i will i pledg to you i will do whatev is necessari to make sure that it stay that way now what can i bring to that challeng when i was a young man my father was a senat oppos to the vietnam war when i graduat from colleg there were plenti of fanci way to get out of go and be a part of that i went and i volunt and i went to vietnam i didn t do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot but i learn what it was like to be an enlist man in the unit state armi in the congress in the hous of repres i serv on the hous intellig committe and i work hard to learn the subject of nuclear arm control and how we can diffus these tension and deal with non prolifer and deal with the problem of terror and these new weapon of mass destruct look we re gonna face some serious new challeng in the next four year i ve work on that long and hard when i went to the unit state senat i ask for an assign to the arm servic committe and while i was there i work on a bipartisan basi as i did in the hous i work with former presid reagan on the modern of our strateg weaponri in the senat i was one of onli ten democrat along with senat joe lieberman to support governor bush s dad in the persian gulf war resolut and for the last eight year i ve serv on the nation secur council can i say just one other thing here
p3233
aVgore fine i ll wait
p3234
aVgore i think he get a oh i m sorri you re right go ahead
p3235
aVgore thank you sir just to finish briefli i start to say that for the last eight year i ve been on the nation secur council last week i broke up i suspend campaign for two day or part of two day to go back and particip in the meet that chart the presid s summit meet that he just return from earlier today and our team of our countri s team over there did a great job it s a difficult situat the unit state has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promot peac and secur and stabil and that mean keep our militari strong now i said earlier that we are the strongest militari but we need to continu improv readi and make sure that our militari personnel are adequ paid and that the combin of their pay and their benefit and their retir as veteran is compar to the stiff competit that s come in this strong economi from the privat sector and i have support the largest pay rais in mani a year and i support anoth one now i also support modern of our strateg and tactic weaponri the governor has propos skip a generat of technolog i think that would be a mistak becaus i think one of the way we ve been abl to be so success in kosovo and bosnia and haiti and in other place is by have the technolog edg you know we won that conflict in kosovo without lose a singl human life in combat a singl american life in combat now readi the trend befor we befor i got my current job were on the declin the number of divis were reduc i argu that we should revers that trend and take it back up and i m happi to tell you that we have now in my budget for the next ten year i propos 100 billion for this purpos the governor propos 45 billion i propos more than twice as much becaus i think it s need
p3236
aVbush if this were a spend contest i would come in second i readili admit i m not go to grow the size of the feder govern like he is your question was deploy it must be in the nation interest must be in our vital interest whether we ever send troop the mission must be clear soldier must understand whi we re go the forc must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplish and the exit strategi need to be well defin i m concern that we re overdeploy around the world see i think the mission has somewhat becom fuzzi should i be fortun enough to earn your confid the mission of the unit state militari will be to be prepar and readi to fight and win war and therefor prevent war from happen in the first place there may be some moment when we use our troop as peacekeep but not often the vice presid mention my view of long term for the militari i want to make sure the equip for our militari is the best it can possibl be of cours but we have an opportun we have an opportun to use our research and develop capac the great technolog of the unit state to make our militari lighter harder to find more lethal we have an opportun realli if you think about it if we re smart and have got a strateg vision and a leader who understand strateg plan to make sure that we chang the term of the battlefield of the futur so we can keep the peac this is a peac nation and i intend to keep the peac spend money is one thing but spend money without a strateg plan can oftentim be wast first thing i m go to do is ask the secretari of defens to develop a plan so we are make sure we re not spend our money on polit project but on project to make sure our soldier are well paid well hous and have the best equip in the world
p3237
aVgore absolut not i refer to the dingl norwood bill it is the bipartisan bill that is now pend in the congress the hmos and the insur compani support the other bill that s pend the one that the republican major has put forward they like it becaus it doesn t accomplish what i think realli need to be accomplish to give the decis back to the doctor and nurs and give you a right of appeal to somebodi other than the hmo or insur compani let you go to the nearest emerg room without have to call an hmo befor you call 911 to let you see a specialist if you need to and it has strong bipartisan support it is be block by the republican leadership in the congress

p3243
aVlieberman befor i answer that veri import question let me first thank you for moder the debat let me thank the wonder peopl here at centr colleg and throughout kentucki for be such gracious host and let me give a special thank you to the peopl of connecticut without whose support over these last 30 year i would never have had the opportun al gore has given me this year and final let me thank my famili that is here with me my wife hadassah our children our sibl and my mom my 85 year old mom gave me some good advic about the debat earlier today she said sweetheart as she s prone to call me rememb be posit and know that i will love you no matter what you re oppon say about you well mom as alway that was both reassur and wise i am go to be posit tonight i m not go to indulg in negat person attack i m go to talk about the issu that matter to the peopl of this countri educ health care retir secur and moral valu i m go to describ the plan that al gore and i have for keep america s prosper go and make sure that it benefit more of america s famili particular the hard work middl class famili who have not yet fulli benefit from the good time we ve had and berni i m go to explain tonight how we re go to do all this and remain fiscal respons let me get to your question
p3244
aVlieberman al gore and i are commit to make america s public school the best in the world i disagre with what my oppon has said a lot of progress has been made in recent year averag test score are up and a lot of work is be done by ten of thousand of parent teacher and administr all around america there is more to be done if you ll allow me i want to go back to your last question it lead to this question i think both of us agre that leav asid the social secur and medicar surplus there s 1 8 trillion in surplus avail to spend over the next ten year we re be fiscal respons about it we re take 300 billion off the top to put in reserv fund the rest we ll use for middl class tax cut and invest in program like educ there s a big differ between these two ticket our oppon with spend 1 6 trillion of the surplus project on a big tax cut that al gore talk about the other night so effect we re save money to invest in educ you cannot reform educ and improv it in this countri without spend some money al gore and i have commit 170 billion for that purpos to recruit 100 000 new teacher to reduc the size of classroom to help local school district build new build so our children are not learn in crumbl classroom and we re not just go to stop at high school we re go to go on and give the middl class the abil to deduct up to 10 000 a year in the cost of colleg tuition now that is a tremend life save chang which will help peopl carri on their educ and allow them to develop the kind of skill that will help them succeed in the hi tech economi of today
p3245
aVcheney this is a veri import issu berni mayb we could extend on educ for a moment
p3246
aVcheney yes
p3247
aVcheney thank you sir
p3248
aVlieberman do i have a chanc to respond
p3249
aVcheney the question of the surplus drive a lot of what we re talk about here joe if you look at our propos we take half of the project surplus and set it asid for social secur over 2 4 trillion we talk rough a fourth of it for other urgent prioriti such as medicar reform and educ sever of these other key program we want to support and we take rough one fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the american taxpay we think it s veri import to do that it is a fundament differ between our two approach if you look frank by our number and the number of the senat budget committe which has total up all the promis that vice presid gore has made dure the cours of the campaign there s some 900 billion in spend over and abov that surplus alreadi and we still have a month to go in the campaign the fact is that the program that we put togeth we think is veri respons suggest that somehow all of it is go for tax cut isn t true anoth way to look at it is over the cours of the next ten year we ll collect rough 25 trillion in revenu we want to take about 5 of that and return that to the american taxpay in the form of tax relief we have the highest level of taxat now we ve had sinc world war ii the averag american famili is pay about 40 in feder state and local tax we think it is appropri to return to the american peopl so that they can make choic themselv in how that money ought to be spent whether on educ retir or on pay their bill it is their choic and prerog we want to give them the opportun to make those kind of choic for themselv and we think this is a total reason approach
p3250
aVlieberman we re not spend ani more than is project from the expert we re set asid 300 billion in a reserv fund the project the nonpartisan expert make aren t quit right keep america out of debt is a way to keep interest rate down and the economi grow
p3251
aVlieberman let me start with the number with all due respect the senat budget committe estim that dick cheney has just refer to are the estim of the partisan republican staff of the senat budget committe we re use the number present by the nonpartisan congression budget offic we start with an agreement which the surplus in the social secur fund should be lock up and use for social secur that s where the agreement end we also agre and believ and pledg that the surplus in the medicar trust fund should also be lock up with a sign on it say that politician keep your hand off our oppon do not do that in fact they raid the medicar trust fund to pay for well their tax cut and other program that they can t afford becaus they ve spent so much on the tax cut let me come back to the remain 1 8 trillion that we both talk about the number show that 1 6 trillion goe to the big tax cut which as al gore said the other night send 43 to the top 1 wors than that when you add on the other spend program that our oppon have commit to plus the cost of their plan to privat social secur they re 1 1 trillion in debt that mean we go back down the road to higher interest rate to higher unemploy to a kind of self tax increas on everi american famili becaus when interest rate go up so too do the cost of mortgag payment car payment student loan credit card transact so if we ve learn anyth over the last eight year it is that one of the most import thing the govern can do the feder govern probabl the most import is to be fiscal respons and that s whi al gore and i are commit to balanc the budget everi year in fact the pay off the debt by the year 2012 when by our calcul our oppon s econom plan still leav america 2 8 trillion in debt
p3252
aVlieberman it s a good and import question obvious in our time fortun great advanc have been made by women achiev the kind of equal that they were too long deni berni your question is absolut right women actual the number i have receiv 72 cent for everi 1 a man receiv in a compar job al gore and i have issu an econom plan in which we ve state specif goal for the futur and one of those goal is to elimin the pay gap between men and women it s unfair and it s unaccept and the first way we will do that is by support the equal pay act which has been propos in congress which give women the right to file legal action against employ who are not treat them fair and not pay them equal second we re go to do everyth we can use government support of busi agenc such as the small busi administr to help women busi owner have an opportun to invest and begin busi and make larger incom themselv and there are other civil right and human right law that i think can come to play here so bottom line this is an unfair and unaccept situat and even though as the economi has risen in the last eight year america s women have risen with it and receiv more incom until women are receiv the same amount of pay for the same job they re do as a man receiv we ve not achiev genuin equal in this countri al gore and i are commit to close that gap and achiev that equal in so mani famili women are a signific bread earner or the onli bread earner so this caus affect not onli the women but famili and the children as well
p3253
aVcheney i share the view that we ought to have equal pay for equal work regardless of someon s gender we have made progress in recent year but i think we have a way to go it s not just about the differenti with respect to women if you look at our oppon s tax propos they discrimin between stay at home mom with children that they take care of themselv and those who go to work or who in fact have their kid taken care of outsid the home you in effect as a stay at home mom get no tax advantag under the gore tax plan as oppos to the bush propos it provid tax relief for everybodi who pay tax it s import to understand the thing we re tri to chang and address in the cours of the campaign and what our agenda is for the futur or plan are for the futur focus veri much about give as much control as we can to individu american be they men or women be they singl or marri as much control as possibl over their own live especi in the area of taxat we want to make certain that the american peopl have the abil to keep more of what they earn and then they can get to decid how to spend it the propos we have from al gore basic doesn t do that it in effect lay out some 29 separ tax credit if you live your life the way they want you to live your life if you behav in a certain way you qualifi for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief bottom line though is 50 million american taxpay out there get no advantag at all out of the gore tax propos wherea under the bush plan everybodi who pay tax will get tax relief
p3254
aVlieberman might i have an opportun to respond
p3255
aVlieberman this is an import differ between us i want to clarifi it briefli if i can the first thing is the tax relief program that we ve propos one of the mani tax credit for the middl class includ a 500 tax credit for stay at home mom just as a way of say we understand that you are perform a servic for our societi we want you to have that tax credit second the number of 50 million american not benefit from our tax cut program is absolut wrong it s an estim done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and it s just plain wrong and second although governor bush say that his tax cut program larg as it is give a tax cut to everybodi as the newspap indic earlier this week the joint committe on taxat a nonpartisan group in congress say the 27 million american don t get what the governor said they would in the tax program al gore and i want to live within our mean we won t give it away as a tax cut and certain not to the 1 of the public that doesn t need it now we re focus on the middl class in the area they tell us they need it tax credit for better and more expens child care tax credit for middl class famili that don t have health insur from their employ the tax deduct i talk about earlier veri excit deduct for up to 10 000 a year in the cost of a colleg tuition a 3 000 tax credit for the cost well actual for a famili member who stay home with a parent or grandpar who is ill and a veri excit tax credit program that i hope i ll have a chanc to talk about later berni that encourag save by peopl earli in life and ani time in life by have the feder govern match save for the 75 million american who make 100 000 or less up to 2 000 a year veri briefli if a young coupl make 50 000 a year save 1 000 the govern will put anoth 1 000 in that account by the time they retir they ll not onli have guarante social secur but more than 200 000 in that retir fund now that s
p3256
aVcheney you have to be a cpa to understand what he just said the fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinari american is never go to ever figur out what they even qualifi for it s a classic exampl of want to have a program in this case a tax program that will in fact direct peopl to live their live in certain way rather than empow them to make decis for themselv it is a big differ between us they like tax credit we like tax reform and tax cut
p3257
aVcheney the abort issu is a veri tough one without question and a veri import one governor bush and i have empathi we want to reduc the incid of abort on our societi mani on the pro choic side have said the same thing even bill clinton has advoc reduc abort to make it as rare as possibl with respect to the question of ru 486 we believ that of cours that it s recent been approv by the fda that realli was a question of whether or not it was safe to be use by women they didn t address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abort in the societi so much as evalu that particular drug what we would like to be abl to do is to look for way to reach across the divid between the two point of view and find thing that we can do togeth to reduc the incid of abort such thing as promot adopt as an altern encourag parent notif and we also think ban the horrif practic of partial birth abort is an area where there could be agreement congress has twice pass by overwhelm margin a signific number from both parti the ban on partial birth abort twice it s been veto by bill clinton and al gore we hope eventu they would recogn that s not a good posit for them to be in with respect to the ru 486 propos at this stage i haven t look at that particular piec of legisl governor bush made it clear the other night he did not anticip that he would be abl to go in an direct the fda to revers cours on that particular issu primarili becaus the decis they made was on the drug not the question of whether or not it would support abort
p3258
aVlieberman it s a veri import question and one on which these two ticket have dramat differ point of view my answer is no i would not support legisl that is be introduc in congress to overrid the food and drug administr decis on ru 486 the administr fda work 12 year on this serious problem they made a judgment base on what was good for women s health a doctor has to pescrib and care for a woman use it i think it s a decis we ought to let stand becaus it was made by expert but let me say more general that the signific differ here on this issu is that al gore and i respect and will protect a woman s right to choos our oppon will not we know that this is a difficult person moral medic issu but that is exact whi it ought to be left under our law to a woman her doctor and her god now one area in which we agre al gore and i we believ that the govern ought to do everyth it can to reduc the number of unwant pregnanc and therefor the number of abort incident here there is good news to report the number of abort is actual down in america over the last eight year in fact over the last eight year the number of teenag pregnanc has drop 20 and the reason it has is that there are good program out there that al gore and i will continu to support such as famili plan and program that encourag abstin but when the health of a woman is involv i think the govern has to be respect i support in fact a bill in the senat that would have prohibit late term abort except in case where the health or life of the mother was involv i did not support the so call partial birth abort bill becaus it would have prohibit that form of abort at ani stage of the pregnanc regardless of the effect on the health and life of the woman that s unaccept
p3259
aVlieberman well there s good news from belgrad today berni as you know it s unconfirm the encourag news is that the state news agenc is report that mr kostunica is the presid elect some press report say that milosev has actual left belgrad they re not confirm that is a veri happi end to a terribl stori it s the end of a reign of terror if that is not confirm and doe not happen then i think the unit state with it european alli ought to do everyth we can to encourag the peopl of serbia to do what they ve been do to rise up and end the reign of terror by milosev and bring themselv back into the famili of nation where they will be welcom by the unit state and other you know i m veri proud on this night as it appear that milosev is about to or has fallen of the leadership role the unit state play in the effort to stop his aggress and genocid in bosnia and kosovo i know oppon have said they thought it was overreach it wasn t it was a matter of principl in america s nation interest and valu the fact is that we stop the aggress we stop the genocid and therefor strengthen our relationship with our european alli in nato and in fact made the unit state more respect and trust by our alli and more fear by our enemi i think that vice presid gore play a critic role passion role in lead the administr along with republican support like bob dole and john mccain to do the right thing in the balkan and hope tonight we re see the final result of that bold and brave effort
p3260
aVcheney i note like joe i m pleas to see what happen in yugoslavia today i hope it mark the end of milosev i think probabl more than anyth els it s a victori for the serbian peopl they ve taken to the street to support their democraci to support their vote in some respect this is a continu of a process that began ten year ago all across eastern europ and has onli now arriv in serbia we saw it in germani rumania czechoslovakia and the peopl of eastern europ rose up and made their claim for freedom and i think we all admir that i think with respect to how this process has been manag most recent we want to do everyth we can to support mr milosev s departur certain though that would not involv commit u s troop i do think it s noteworthi that there appear to be an effort underway to get the russian involv i note the other night for exampl tuesday night at the debat in boston governor bush suggest exact that we ought to tri to get the russian involv to exercis some leverag over the serbian it s now clear from the press that in fact that s exact what they were do it s governor bush was correct in his assess and his recommend he has support the administr on kosovo he lobbi activ against passag of the byrd warner provis which would have set a specif deadlin one he felt was too soon for forc the u s troop out he s been support of the polici that we ve seen with respect to yugoslavia and i think he deserv a lot of credit for that i would go beyond that i think this is an opportun for the unit state to test presid putin of russia now is the time we ought to find out whether he s commit to democraci whether he s will to support the forc of freedom and democraci there in the area of eastern europ and it s a test for him whether he repres the old guard in the soviet union one of the most import challeng we face as a nation is how we manag that process of integr those 150 million eastern european into the secur and econom framework of europ
p3261
aVcheney my prefer is to deploy them as warrior there may be occas when it s appropri to use them in a peacekeep role but i think the role ought to be limit a time limit on it the reason we have a militari is to be abl to fight and win war and to maintain with suffici strength so that would be adversari are deter from ever launch a war in the first place i think that the administr has in fact in this area fail in a major respons we ve seen a reduct in our forc far beyond anyth that was justifi by the end of the cold war at the same time we ve seen a rapid expans of our commit around the world as troop have been sent hither and yon there was testimoni befor the joint chief of staff befor the arm servic committe that point out a lot of these problem general mike ryan of the air forc with 40 fewer aircraft he s now undertak three time as mani deploy on a regular basi as he had to previous we re overcommit and underresourc this has had some other unfortun effect i saw a letter the other day from a young captain station in fort bragg a graduat of west point in 95 get readi to get out of the servic becaus he s onli allow to train with his troop when fuel is avail for the vehicl and onli allow to fire their weapon twice a year he s concern if he had to ever go into combat there would be live lost it s a legitim concern the fact the u s militari is wors off today than it was eight year ago it s a high prioriti for myself and governor bush to rebuild the u s militari and to give them good leadership and build up the forc
p3262
aVcheney i want to thank the peopl here in danvill kentucki and i m delight to be here tonight i want to avoid ani person attack i promis not to bring up your sing laughter
p3263
aVlieberman i want to assur the american peopl that the american militari is the best train best equip most power forc in the world and that al gore and i will do whatev it take to keep them that way it s not right and it s not good for our militari to run them down essenti in the midst of a partisan polit debat the fact is that you ve got to judg the militari by what the militari leader say secretari bill cohen and the chairman of the joint chief of staff will both tell you the american militari is readi to meet ani threat we may face in the world today the fact is judg by it result from desert storm to the balkan bosnia and kosovo to the oper that are still be conduct to keep saddam hussein in a box in iraq the american militari has perform brilliant this administr has turn around the drop in spend that began in the mid 80 s and right through the bush cheney administr but now it s stop we pass the largest pay increas in a generat for our militari and the interest fact here in spite of the rhetor that my oppon has just spoken the realiti is if you look at our project budget for the next ten year al gore and i actual commit twice as much 100 billion in addit fund for our militari than governor bush doe and their budget allow noth addit for acquisit of new weapon system that s the same thing that the chief of the servic will not be happi about they need the new equip the new system that al gore and i are commit to give them
p3264
aVcheney this is a special interest of mine i would like a chanc to elabor further if i might the fact are dramat differ i m not attack the militari joe i have enorm regard for the men and women of the u s militari i had the privileg of work with them while i was the secretari of defens no one has a higher regard than i do for them it s irrespons to suggest we shouldn t have that debat that we should ignor what is a major major concern if you have friend and relat serv in the u s militari you know there s a problem if you look at the data that s avail 40 of our armi helicopt are not combat readi the combat readi level in the air forc drop from 85 to 65 signific problem of retent the import thing for us to rememb is that we re a democraci and we re defend by volunt everybodi out there tonight wear the uniform stand on guard to protect the unit state is there becaus they volunt to put on a uniform when we don t give them the spare part they need when we don t give our pilot the fli hour they need when we don t give them the kind of leadership that spell out what their mission is and let s them know whi they re put their live at risk then we undermin that moral that s an extraordinarili valuabl trust there is no more import respons for a presid of the unit state than his role as command in chief when he decid when to send our young men and women to war when we send them without the right kind of train when we send them poor equip or with equip that s old and broken down we put their live at risk we will suffer more casualti in the next conflict if we don t look to those basic problem now this administr has a bad track record in this regard and it s avail for anybodi who want to look at the record and want to talk to our men and women in uniform and want to spend time with the member of the joint chief want to look at readi level and other other indic final point the issu of procur is veri import becaus we re run now off the buildup of the invest we made dure the reagan year as that equip get old it has to be replac we ve taken money out of the procur budget to support other ventur we have not been invest in the futur of the u s militari
p3265
aVlieberman it s import to respond to this yes of cours it s an import debat to have as part of this campaign but i don t want either the militari to feel uneasi or the american peopl to feel insecur what i m say now i m base on serv on the senat arm servic committe talk to exact the peopl dick cheney has mention the secretari of defens the chief of staff i ve visit our fight forc around the world i m tell you that we are readi to meet ani conting that might aris the good news here and the interest news is that we have met our recruit target in each of the servic this year in fact in the area where our oppon have said we are overextend such as the balkan the soldier there have a higher rate of re enlist than anywher els in the servic becaus they feel a sens of purpos a sens of mission in fact this administr has begun to transform the american militari to take it away from be a cold war forc to prepar it to meet the threat of the new generat of tomorrow of weapon of mass destruct terror cyber warfar the fact is that governor bush recommend in his major polici statement on the militari earlier this year that we skip the next generat of militari equip helicopt submarin tactic air fighter all the rest that would realli crippl our readi exact the readi that dick cheney is talk about al gore and i are commit to continu this acquisit program transform the militari there s fewer peopl in uniform today but person to person person by person unit by unit this is the most power and effect militari not onli in the world today but in the histori of the world and again al gore and i will do whatev is necessari to keep it that way
p3266
aVcheney it has been a difficult area to work in for a long time numer administr go back to world war ii have had to wrestl with the problem of what should happen to the middl east we made signific breakthrough at the end of the bush administr becaus of the gulf war we had join togeth with arab alli and done enorm damag to the iraqi arm forc iraq was the biggest militari threat to israel by virtu of the end of the cold war the soviet were no longer a factor they use to fish in troubl water whenev they had the opportun in the middl east with the end of the soviet union the implos of the empir that creat a vacuum and made it easier for us to oper there we were abl to i think reassur both arab and isra would play a major role there we would deploy forc if we had to to engag in militari oper to help our friend we were abl to conven them in a confer the first time arab and isra sat down face to face and began this process of tri to move the peac process forward i think also a lot of credit goe to some great men like yitzak rabin his tragic pass was a great tragedi for everybodi who care about peac in the middl east he was a man who had the militari statur to be abl to confid persuad the isra to take risk for peac i think barak has tri to same thing i hope that we can get this resolv as soon as possibl my guess is the next administr is go to be the one that is go to have to come to grip with the current state of affair there i think it s veri import that we have an administr where we have a presid with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of deal straight with peopl of keep his word so friend and alli both respect us and our adversari fear us
p3267
aVcheney we might have no other choic we ll have to see if that happen the thing about iraq of cours was at the end of the war we had pretti well decim their militari we had put them back in the box so to speak we had a strong intern coalit raid against them effect econom sanction and an inspect regim was in place under the u n and it was abl to do a good job of strip out the capac to build weapon of mass destruct the work he had been do that had not been destroy dure the war in biolog and chemic agent as well as a nuclear program unfortun now we find ourselv in a situat where that start to fray on us where the coalit now no longer is tie tight togeth recent the unit arab emir have reopen diplomat relat with baghdad the russian and french are fli commerci airlin back into baghdad and thumb their nose at the intern sanction regim we re in a situat today where our postur with iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war it s unfortun i also think it s unfortun we find ourselv in a posit where we don t know for sure what might be transpir insid iraq i certain hope he s not regener that kind of capabl but if he were if in fact saddam hussein were take step to tri to rebuild nuclear capabl or weapon of mass destruct you would have to give veri serious consider to militari action to to stop that activ i don t think you can afford to have a man like saddam hussein with nuclear weapon in the middl east
p3268
aVlieberman it would of cours be a veri serious situat if we had evid credibl evid that saddam hussein was develop weapon of mass destruct i must say i don t think a polit campaign is the occas to declar exact what we would do in that case i think that s a matter of such critic nation secur import that it ought to be left to the command in chief leader of the militari secretari of state to make that kind of decis without the heat of a polit campaign the fact is that we will not enjoy real stabil in the middl east until saddam hussein is gone the gulf war was a great victori and incident al gore and i were two of the ten democrat in the senat who cross parti line to support presid bush and secretari cheney in that war we re proud we did that the war did not end with a total victori saddam hussein remain there as a result we have had almost ten year now of instabl we have continu to oper almost all of this time militari action to enforc a no fli zone we have been struggl with saddam about the inspector we re do everyth we can to get the inspector back in there but in the end there s not go to be peac until he goe and that s whi i was proud to co sponsor the iraq liber act with senat trent lott where i have kept in touch with the iraqi opposit broad base we met with them earlier this year we are support them in their effort and will continu to support them until the iraqi peopl rise up and do what the peopl of serbia have done in the last few day get rid of a despot we ll welcom you back into the famili of nation where you belong
p3269
aVlieberman i promis not to sing
p3270
aVlieberman not enough but this administr and vice presid gore and i have had both a long term strategi to develop energi independ and a short term strategi in fact if the this administr had been given the amount of fund that it had request from the republican congress we would be further along in the implement of that long term strategi aim at develop cleaner sourc of energi give tax credit to individu and busi to conserv and use energi more effici aim at a partnership for a new generat of vehicl with the american automobil industri which is make great progress and can produc a vehicl that can get 80 mile per gallon we also have a short term strategi to deal with exact the kind of up and down of energi price i know it was controversi but al gore and i believ it was import in the short term to reach into the strateg petroleum reserv put it in the market show the big oil compani and the opec oil produc countri that we have resourc we can fight back we aren t go to lay back and let them roll over our economi we did it also becaus gasolin price were rise and home heat oil inventori were real low both of our ticket agre on keep the low incom hous assist program but our oppon offer no assist to middl class famili hit by rise gas price and a shortag of home heat oil now the price of oil on world market has drop 6 a barrel that s a good result and i m proud of it
p3271
aVcheney this is an area where i think again joe and i have fair signific disagr my assess is that there is no comprehens energi polici today that as a nation we are in troubl becaus the administr has not address these issu we have the prospect of brownout in california we have a potenti home heat oil crisi in the northeast we have gasolin price rise in various other place for year now the administr has talk about reduc our depend on foreign sourc of oil but they haven t done it in fact we ve gone exact in the opposit direct we have the lowest rate of domest product of oil now in 46 year you have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produc as littl oil as we do today our import are at an all time record high in june we import almost 12 million barrel of oil a day we have other problem we don t have refineri capac we haven t built a new refineri in this countri for ten year they re oper at 96 or 97 capac even with more crude avail they re probabl not go to be abl to do veri much by way of produc addit home heat oil we have a grow problem with our grow depend on foreign sourc of energi we ought to be abl to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direct we need to do a lot more about generat the capac for power here at home we need to get on with the busi and we think we can do it veri safe in an environment sound manner we don t think we ought to buy into this fals choic that somehow we cannot develop energi resourc without be cautious with the environ we can we have the technolog to do it and we ought to do it we do support the low incom energi assist program we think it s import that senior citizen don t suffer this winter but we need to get on to the busi of have a plan to develop our domest energi resourc in produc more suppli and this administr hasn t produc them
p3272
aVcheney it show i have a balanc approach to how we deal with environment issu
p3273
aVcheney i think we have to make choic i work on that with my good friend al simpson for about four year we set asid a part of wyom near a million acr of wilder that ought to be separ and not be develop we think that was import there are a lot of area where governor bush and i support restraint we support the moratorium on drill off the coast of california but there are place where we think we ought to go forward and develop those resourc the arctic nation wildlif reserv is one of them it s on the north slope right next to prudho bay the infrastructur is there to be abl to deliv that product to market we think we can do it given today s technolog in a way that will not damag the environ will not perman marr the countrysid at all and so what we re look for with respect to environment polici and energi polici is balanc we do have to make choic we recogn that the way you phrase the question frank i welcom becaus it show in fact we are tri to pursu a balanc approach and the suggest that somehow all we care about is energi develop isn t true but we do have to get on with develop those resourc or we re go to find ourselv ever more depend on foreign sourc we re go to find that the fact that we don t have an energi polici out there is one of the major storm cloud on the horizon for our economi i think if you look for someth that could develop some problem that could aris that might in fact jeopard our continu prosper it s the possibl that we might find ourselv without adequ suppli of energi in the futur and there would be no quicker way to shut down our economi than that
p3274
aVlieberman berni we agre on the problem but we couldn t disagre more on the respons to the problem the problem is accur state no matter how strong we are econom if we remain depend on a sourc of energi that is outsid our control we re not go to be as strong as we should be other around the world can effect yank our chain and we cannot allow that to continu to happen i m afraid that our oppon s respons to this is one side and it is essenti to develop the resourc within the unit state almost regardless of where i m against drill in the arctic refug this is one of the most beauti pristin place that the good lord has creat on earth it happen to be within the unit state of america it s not worth it to do that for what seem to be the possibl of six month worth of oil seven to 12 year from now that s not much of a respons to the immedi problem that gasolin consum and home heat oil custom are face this winter there are more resourc within the unit state that we can develop this isn t mention much and appreci much in the last eight year drill for gas on feder land has gone up 60 and it s been done in an environment protect way the administr has encourag the drill for deep gas and oil go on in the western gulf today the answer here is new technolog that will creat million of new job let me just say this if we can get three mile more per gallon from our car we ll get a we ll save 1 million barrel of oil a day which is exact what the refug at it best in alaska would produc the choic to me is clear we have to develop fuel cell altern energi encourag peopl to conserv and to be effici
p3275
aVlieberman yes inde i can pledg to the american peopl categor that no one will lose benefit under our plan for social secur as far forward as 2054 and let me come back and say berni that al gore and i view social secur as probabl the best thing the govern did in the second half the last centuri it has creat a floor under which senior cannot fall and so mani of them depend on it for their basic live for their livelihood it s critic import to protect it that s whi al and i have commit to put that social secur surplus in a lockbox not touch it that s what allow us to keep social secur solvent to 2054 our oppon have an idea for privat social secur that will jeopard social secur payment to recipi and i look at this idea if i may use an oil industri analog which is to say that sometim as you know dick better than i you have to dig deep whether there s oil in a well for a while i was drill into this idea of privat of social secur it requir take as much as a trillion dollar out of the social secur fund the independ analyst have said that would put the fund out of money in 2023 or if it s not out of money benefit will have to be cut by over 50 that s just not worth do al gore and i are go to guarante social secur and add to it the retir save plan that i mention earlier which will help middl class famili look forward they will have not onli social secur but a superb extra retir account as well social secur plus with us with all due respect social secur minus from the bush cheney ticket
p3276
aVcheney good i think this is an extraordinarili import decis we ll make on novemb 7th we re realli go to choos between what i consid to be an old way of govern ourselv or a new cours a new era if you will of high level of spend high tax ever more intrus bureaucraci and governor bush and i want to offer that new cours of action with respect to the surplus berni we have to make some kind of forecast we can t make 12 month decis in this busi we re talk about the kind of fundament chang in program and govern that are go to affect peopl s live for the next 25 or 30 year and while it may be a littl riski in some respect from an econom standpoint to tri to forecast surplus i think we have to make some plan assumpt to proceed we care a great deal about the issu at stake here one of the difficulti we have frank for the last eight year we ignor a lot of these problem we haven t move aggress on social secur on medicar there are import issu out there that need to be resolv it s import for us to get on with that busi that s what governor bush and i want to do
p3277
aVcheney you won t be surpris if i disagre the social secur system is in troubl it s been a fantast program and been there for 65 year that has provid benefit for senior citizen over that period of time for my parent it mean a great deal to million of american and governor bush and i want to make absolut certain that the first thing we do is guarante the continu of those payment those benefit and keep those promis that were made but if you look down the road you say you re 30 year old today and i have two daughter about that age they serious question whether or not there will be ani system left for them that s becaus the demograph that work out there it s almost an iron law they know how mani peopl there are we know when the babi boom generat is come along it will drive the system into bankruptci unless we reform and deal with it the reform we would like to offer is to allow our young peopl to begin to take a portion of the payrol tax 2 of it and invest it in a person retir account that doe sever thing first of all it give them a stake in the social secur system that becom their properti they own it they can pass it on to their kid if they want they don t have that kind of equiti in social secur today second we can generat a higher return off that invest than you get in the exist system you get about a 2 return of what you pay into social secur we can generat at least 6 at least three time what we re abl to get now and long term by generat a bigger return we ll put addit fund into the system that will help to surviv that crunch that is otherwis go to hit in the futur bottom line is there s a choic here with respect to al gore and joe s plan they don t reform social secur they add anoth huge oblig on top of it that futur generat will have to pay they don t reform it and don t save it we have a plan to do that and a plan to give our young peopl a choic and more control over their own live
p3278
aVcheney well i think there are a number of way to do it first of all i agre with your assess i ve been out of washington for the last eight year and spent the last five year run a compani global concern and been out in the privat sector build a busi hire peopl creat job i have a differ perspect on washington than i had when i was there in the past i m proud of my servic for 25 year but also proud i had the opportun to go out and get a differ experi and you re absolut right peopl are fed up they ve had enough with the bicker and the partisanship that seem to character the debat that goe on in the nation s capit i ve seen it done differ in texa i ve watch georg bush and one of the reason i was eager to sign on when he ask me to becom his run mate is becaus i ve been so tremend impress with what he s done as the governor of texa he came in when he had a legislatur complet control by the other parti he manag to reach across partisan line and put them to work to achiev good thing for the state of texa part becaus he didn t point the finger of blame look for scapegoat he was quick to share the credit he end up as a result of that activ have the top democrat in the state bob bulloch endors georg bush for reelect it s possibl to chang the tone it is possibl to get peopl to work togeth and to begin to focus on achiev result i think it will take new leadership i don t think you can do it with all due respect to al gore with somebodi who spent all the last 24 year in that washington environ and who campaign on the basi of castig other point the finger of blame at other in term of blame busi or various group for fail i think you have to be abl to reach out and work togeth and build coalit i think georg w bush has done it in texa and can do it at the nation level
p3279
aVlieberman you re absolut right there s too much partisanship in washington it puzzl me you think peopl in public life and polit would want to do what would make them popular and too often peopl in both parti act in a way that bring down the institut of govern and it s a shame i have tri veri hard in my career to call them as i see them and work with colleagu on both side of the aisl to get thing done i m proud of my record in that regard and i certain think that would be an asset that i could bring to the vice presid i work with john mccain on cultur valu i work with conni mack on foreign polici don nichol on the intern religi freedom act if i go on much longer i ll get in troubl with my own parti that s the way thing get done i m proud of those partnership let me say a word about al gore in his year in the hous and senat he form similar bipartisan partnership if you look back over the last eight year the most signific accomplish of this administr in which al gore was central involv were the result most of them of bipartisan agreement after all the welfar reform act which al gore promis to lead the effort on to get peopl off of welfar to set time limit to get peopl to enjoy the digniti of work that was a bipartisan act that was adopt the anti crime act that has help to lower crime more than 20 in our countri was also bipartisan the balanc budget act of 1997 which was critic to get our economi to the point and our govern to the point of unpreced surplus we enjoy today also was bipartisan and al gore was involv i would say that s exact the kind of bipartisan leadership that he and i can bring to washington to get thing done
p3280
aVcheney with all due respect joe there s an aw lot of evid that there hasn t been ani bipartisan leadership out of this administr or al gore medic problem have not been address we have had eight year of problem with prescript drug not be address social secur problem not been address the educ problem has not been address they ve been in a posit of respons in the white hous the power interest if you will in washington d c and been unabl to work with other medicar is a good exampl a good effort at a bipartisan solut for medicar whether you bought or didn t buy the answer that was generat the fact is the administr set it up and pull the plug on it becaus they would rather have an issu not a solut they haven t read from a bipartisan standpoint and i think al gore s record isn t veri good
p3281
aVlieberman dick cheney must be one of the few peopl who think noth has been accomplish in the last eight year promis were made and promis were kept has al gore did al gore make promis in 1992 absolut did he deliv big time let me put it that way that s the record look at the 20 look at the 22 million new job look at the 4 million new busi look at the lower interest rate low rate of inflat high rate of growth i think if you ask most peopl in america today that famous question that ronald reagan ask are you better off today than you were eight year ago most peopl would say yes i m pleas to see dick from the newspap that you re better off than you were eight year ago too
p3282

aVlieberman i would be outrag it is such an assault on the basic promis that america make that the law will treat individu as individu regardless of their status that is to say their race their nation their gender sexual orient etcetera etcetera and the sad fact is that racial profil occur in this countri i have a few african american friend who have gone through this horror and you know it make me want to kind of hit the wall becaus it s such an assault on their human and their citizenship we can t toler it anymor that s whi i support legisl in congress it s the most we could get done to do a hard studi to make the case of the extent to which racial profil is occur in our countri but it s also whi i m so proud that al gore said two thing first we would issu if we re fortun enough to be elect an execut order prohibit racial profil and second the first civil right act legisl we would send to congress would be a nation ban on racial profil it is just wrong it is unamerican and to think that in the 21st centuri this kind of nonsens is still go on we have to stop it the onli way to stop it is through the law the law after all is meant to express our valu and our aspir for our societi and our valu are violent contradict by the kind of racial profil that exist i had a friend a while ago who work in the govern work at the white hous african american stop surround by polic for no other caus that anyon can determin than the color of his skin that can t be in america anymor
p3287
aVcheney berni i would like to answer your question to the best of my abil but i don t think i can understand fulli what it would be like i tri hard to put myself in that posit and imagin what it would be like but i ve alway been part of the major never part of a minor group it has to be a horribl experi we still have the sens of anger and frustrat that go with know that the onli reason you were stop the onli reason you were arrest was becaus of the color of your skin would make me extraordinarili angri and i m not sure how i would respond i think that we have to recogn that while we ve made enorm progress in the u s in racial relat and come a veri long way we still have a veri long way to go we still have not onli the problem we re talk about here tonight in term of the problem you mention in profil but beyond that we still have an achiev gap in educ incom differenti differ in life span we still have i think a societi that where we haven t done enough yet to live up to that standard that we d all like to live up to i think in term of equal of opportun that we judg peopl as individu as martin luther king said we ought to judg peopl on the context of their charact instead of the color of their skin i would hope we can make progress on that in the year ahead
p3288
aVlieberman veri current and difficult question i ve been think about it i want to explain what my thought have been mayb i should begin this answer by go back to the begin of the countri and the declar of independ which say there at the outset that all of us are creat equal and that we re endow not by ani bunch of politician and philosoph but by our creator with those right of life liberti and the pursuit of happi at the begin of our histori that promis and ideal was not realiz or experienc by all american but over time sinc then we have extend the orbit of that promis in our time at the frontier of that effort is extend those kind of right to gay and lesbian american who are citizen of this countri and children of the same awesom god just as much as ani of the rest of us are that s whi i have been an origin co sponsor of the employ non discrimin act which aim to prevent gay and lesbian american who are otherwis qualifi from be discrimin against in the workplac and i ve sponsor other piec of legisl and taken other action that carri out that ideal the question you pose is a difficult one for this reason it confront or challeng the tradit notion of marriag as be limit to a heterosexu coupl which i support i must say i m think about this becaus i have friend who are in gay and lesbian partnership who said to me isn t it fair we don t have legal right to inherit visit when one partner is ill to health care benefit that s whi i m think about it my mind is open to take some action that will address those element of unfair while respect the tradit religi and civil institut of marriag
p3289
aVcheney this is a tough one berni the fact of the matter is we live in a free societi and freedom mean freedom for everybodi we shouldn t be abl to choos and say you get to live free and you don t that mean peopl should be free to enter into ani kind of relationship they want to enter into it s no one s busi in term of regul behavior in that regard the next step then of cours is the question you ask of whether or not there ought to be some kind of offici sanction of the relationship or if they should be treat the same as a tradit marriag that s a tougher problem that s not a slam dunk the fact of the matter is that matter is regul by the state i think differ state are like to come to differ conclus and that s appropri i don t think there should necessarili be a feder polici in this area i tri to be open mind about it as much as i can and toler of those relationship and like joe i m also wrestl with the extent to which there ought to be legal sanction of those relationship i think we ought to do everyth we can to toler and accommod whatev kind of relationship peopl want to enter into
p3290
aVcheney i think public educ is a solut our desir is to find way to reform our educ system to return it to it former glori i m a product of public school my famili wife and daughter all went to public school we believ veri much in the public school system but if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation recent exam for exampl the nation assess of educ progress an independ test servic show there s no progress on read score in the last eight year almost no progress on math we ve had a signific increas in spend for educ nationwid but it has produc almost no posit result that s unaccept from our standpoint if you look at it and think about it we now have in our most disadvantag communiti 70 of our fourth grader can t read at the basic level of understand we ve graduat 15 million kid from high school in the last few year who can t read at a signific level what we want to do is to chang that we think we know how to do it governor bush has done it in texa we want to emphas local control we want to insist on high standard one of the worst thing we can do is fail to establish high standard to say we don t have the same kind of expect from you that we have from everybodi els we want account we have to test everi child everi year to know whether or not we re make progress with respect to achiev those goal and object we think it s extraordinarili import probabl the singl most import issu in this campaign governor bush has made it clear that when he s elect this will be his number one prioriti as a legisl measur to submit to the congress
p3291

p3292
aVlieberman you re human like we are
p3293
aVcheney we clear come from differ polit perspect joe is a democrat from new england i m a republican from the west from wyom and i think that weigh into it to some extent clear we re both in the posit we re in becaus of our person relationship with our princip i think the area that i would bring are the thing that governor bush emphas when he pick me that i have been white hous chief of staff and ran the white hous under presid ford spent ten year in the hous eight of that in the leadership serv as secretari of defens and then had signific experi in the privat sector i think that where there are differ between joe and myself in term of background and experi i clear have spent a lot of time in execut posit run larg organ both in privat busi as well as in govern and that is a set of qualif that governor bush found attract when he select me i ll leav it at that
p3294
aVlieberman i have great respect for dick cheney i don t agre with a lot of thing he said in this campaign he was a veri distinguish secretari of defens and i don t have anyth negat to say about him i want to say with the humil that is requir to respond to this statement that i think what i would bring to the offic of the vice presid is a lifetim experi grow up in a work class famili have the opportun to go to a great public school system then to go on to colleg and then to be drawn realli by presid kennedi as well as the valu of servic my famili gave me into public life want to make a differ i have had extraordinari opportun thank again to those folk back home in connecticut as a senat attorney general tri to enforc the law to protect them and the environ and consum and to litig on behalf of human right and for the last 12 year as a member of the senat of the unit state focus on nation secur question environment protect econom growth and valu but perhap what i most bring is a friendship and share valu and share prioriti with al gore i have tremend respect for al gore i ve known him for 15 year he s an outstand person as a public offici and as a privat person his life is built on his faith it s devot to his famili he volunt for servic in vietnam from the begin in congress he s been will to take on the big interest and fight for averag peopl as vice presid i think he s been the most effect vice presid in the histori of the unit state and he has the right program to use the prosper all the american peopl have earn to help particular hard work middl class famili rais up their children to enjoy a better life i think that s what this is all about whi i m so proud to be his run mate

p3298
aVlieberman berni you ll not be surpris to hear that i disagre first let me talk about that joke about religion which i found veri distast and believ me if anybodi has devot his life to respect the role of religion in american life and understand that american from the begin of our histori have turn to god for strength and purpos it s me and ani offens that was done i apolog for i thought that humor was unaccept let me come to the question of hollywood and then answer the general question al gore and i have felt for a long time first as parent and then onli second as public offici that we cannot let america s parent stand alon in this competit that they feel they re in with hollywood to rais their own kid and give their kid the faith and valu they want to give them i ve been a consist crusad on that behalf john mccain and i actual request the feder trade commiss report that came out three or four week ago which prove conclus that the entertain industri was market adult rate product to our children that is just not accept one find was that they were actual use 10 to 12 year old to test screen adult rate product when that report came out al gore and i said to the entertain industri stop it if you don t stop it in six month we ll ask the feder trade commiss to take action against you we repeat that messag when we went to los angel i repeat it today we won t stop until the entertain industri stop market it product to our children al gore and i i m out mayb i can come back to it

p3301
aVcheney berni i want to thank you and joe as well i ve enjoy the debat this even and thank the folk here at the centr colleg in danvill kentucki this is a veri import decis you re go to make on novemb 7 we have a fundament choic between whether or not we continu with our old way of big govern high tax and ever more intrus bureaucraci or whether we take a new cours for a new era governor bush and i want to pursu the new cours we want to reform the social secur system to guarante benefit will be there for our retir folk as well as make it possibl for our young peopl to invest a portion of their payrol tax into a retir account that they ll control and give them greater control over their own live we want to reform the medicar system to make certain the benefit are there for our senior citizen but also to provid prescript drug coverag for them and give them a rang of choic in term of the kind of insur we have we want to reform the educ system we want to restor our public school to the great they onc repres so that everi parent has the opportun to choos what is best for their child and so that everi child has an opportun to share in the american dream we also want to reform the tax code we think it s veri import now that we have a surplus that a portion of that surplus go back to the peopl who earn it it s not the govern s money it s your money you re entitl to it and we would like to see to it that we provid tax relief for everybodi who pay tax final we think it s veri import to rebuild the u s militari the militari is in troubl the trend are in the wrong direct the finest men and women in uniform that you ll find anyplac in the world but they deserv our support they deserv the resourc that we need to provid for them and they deserv good leadership georg bush is the man to do this i ve seen him do it in texa what we need is to be abl to reach across the aisl put togeth coalit of republican and democrat and build the kind of coalit that will get someth done in washington georg bush is a man of great integr that will make a first rate presid
p3302
aVlieberman thank you berni it was a great even applaus
p3303
aVcheney well gwen the 90 percent figur is just dead wrong when you includ the iraqi secur forc that have suffer casualti as well as the alli they ve taken almost 50 percent of the casualti in oper in iraq which leav the u s with 50 percent not 90 percent
p3304
aVwith respect to the cost it wasn t 200 billion you probabl weren t there to vote for that but 120 billion is in fact what has been alloc to iraq the rest of it s for afghanistan and the global war on terror
p3305
aVthe alli have step forward and agre to reduc and forgiv iraqi debt to the tune of near 80 billion by one estim that plus 14 billion they promis in term of direct aid put the overal alli contribut financi at about 95 billion not to the 120 billion we ve got but you know better than 40 percent so your fact are just wrong senat
p3306
aVyou also have a situat where you talk about credibl
p3307
aVit s aw hard to convey a sens of credibl to alli when you vote for the war and then you declar wrong war wrong place wrong time you vote for the war and then you vote against support the troop when they need the equip the fuel the spare part and the ammunit and the bodi armor
p3308
aVyou re not credibl on iraq becaus of the enorm inconsist that john kerri and you have cite time after time after time dure the cours of the campaign whatev the polit pressur of the moment requir that s where you re at but you ve not been consist and there s no indic at all that john kerri has the convict to success carri through on the war on terror
p3309
aVedward may i respond briefli
p3310
aVwhat the vice presid has just said is just a complet distort the american peopl saw john kerri on thursday night they don t need the vice presid or the presid to tell them what they saw
p3311
aVthey saw a man who was strong who had convict who is resolut who made it veri clear that he will do everyth that has to be done to find terrorist to keep the american peopl safe
p3312
aVhe laid out his plan for success in iraq made it clear that we were commit to success in iraq we have to be becaus we have troop on the ground there and becaus they have creat a haven for terrorist
p3313
aVcheney your rhetor senat would be a lot more credibl if there was a record to back it up there isn t and you cannot use talk tough dure the cours of a 90 minut debat in a presidenti campaign to obscur a 30 year record in the unit state senat and prior to that by john kerri who has consist come down on the wrong side of all the major defens issu that he s face as a public offici
p3314
aVcheney i m say specif that i don t believ he has the qualiti we need in a command in chief becaus i don t think base on his record that he would pursu the kind of aggress polici that need to be pursu if we re go to defeat these terrorist we need to battl them oversea so we don t have to battl them here at home
p3315
aVi m not challeng john kerri s patriot i said in my accept speech in new york citi at the republican convent that we respect his servic in vietnam and i got applaus for that
p3316
aVwe ve never critic his patriot what we ve question is his judgment
p3317
aVand his judgment s flaw and the record s there for anybodi who want to look at it
p3318
aVin 1984 when he ran for the senat he oppos or call for the elimin of a great mani major weapon system that were crucial to win the cold war and are import today to our overal forc
p3319
aVwhen saddam hussein invad kuwait and occupi it in 1990 and 91 he stood up on the floor of the senat and vote against go in to liber kuwait and push saddam hussein back to iraq
p3320
aVcheney gwen i want to thank you and i want to thank the folk here at case western reserv for host this tonight it s a veri import event and they ve done a superb job of put it togeth
p3321
aVthe problem we have is that if you look at his record he doesn t display the qualiti of somebodi who has convict
p3322
aVand with respect to this particular oper we ve seen a situat in which first they vote to commit the troop to send them to war john edward and john kerri then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provid them with the resourc they need bodi armor spare part ammunit they vote against it
p3323
aVi couldn t figur out whi that happen initi and then i look and figur out that what was happen was howard dean was make major progress in the democrat primari run away with the primari base on an anti war record so they in effect decid they would cast an anti war vote and they vote against the troop
p3324
aVnow if they couldn t stand up to the pressur that howard dean repres how can we expect them to stand up to al qaida
p3325
aVedward thank you
p3326
aVone thing that s veri clear is that a long resum doe not equal good judgment i mean we ve seen over and over and over the misjudg made by this administr
p3327
aVi want to go back to what the vice presid just said becaus it s a continu of the thing he s been do unfortun on the campaign trail it s a continu of what he began his first answer with tonight
p3328
aVjohn kerri has vote for the biggest militari appropri bill in the countri s histori john kerri has vote for the biggest intellig appropri in the countri s histori
p3329
aVthis vice presid when he was secretari of defens cut over 80 weapon system includ the veri one he s critic john kerri for vote against these are weapon system a big chunk of which the vice presid himself suggest we get rid of after the cold war
p3330
aVit s import to look at all of our develop in iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror and after 9 11 it becam clear that we had to do sever thing to have a success strategi to win the global war on terror specif that we had to go after the terrorist where ever we might find them that we also had to go after state sponsor of terror those who might provid sanctuari or safe harbor for terror and we also then final had to stand up democraci in their stead afterward becaus that was the onli way to guarante that these state would not again becom safe harbor for terror or for the develop of dead weapon
p3331
aVthe realiti is that john kerri has consist support the veri men that he serv with in vietnam and led
p3332
aVon the 87 billion it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peac we re see the consequ of that everyday on the ground right now
p3333
aVwe stood up and said for our troop we must have a plan to win the peac
p3334
aVwe also thought it was wrong to have a 20 billion fund out of which 7 5 billion was go to go to a no bid contract for halliburton the vice presid s former compani
p3335
aVit was wrong then it s wrong now
p3336
aVcheney well gwen i think the record speak for itself these are two individu who have been for the war when the headlin were good and against it when their poll rate were bad
p3337
aVwe have not seen the kind of consist that a command in chief has to have in order to be a leader in wartim and in order to be abl to see the strategi through to victori
p3338
aVif we want to win the war on terror it seem to me it s pretti clear the choic is georg bush not john kerri
p3339
aVconcern about iraq specif focus on the fact that saddam hussein had been for year list on the state sponsor of terror that they he had establish relationship with abu nidal who oper out of baghdad he paid 25 000 to the famili of suicid bomber and he had an establish relationship with al qaida specif look at georg tenet the cia director s testimoni befor the committe on foreign relat two year ago when he talk about a 10 year relationship
p3340
aVedward john kerri has been absolut clear and consist from the begin that we must stay focus on the peopl who attack us that saddam hussein was a threat that need to be address direct that the weapon inspector need to have time to do their job
p3341
aVhad they had time to do their job they would have discov what we now know that in fact saddam hussein had no weapon that in fact saddam hussein has no connect with 9 11 that in fact saddam hussein has littl or no connect with al qaida
p3342
aVedward well let s start with what we know what we know is that the presid and the vice presid have not done the work to build the coalit that we need dramat differ than the first gulf war we know that they haven t done it and we know they can t do it
p3343
aVthey didn t by the way just reject the alli go into lead up to the war they also reject them in the effort to do the reconstruct in iraq and that has consequ
p3344
aVwhat we believ is as part of our entir plan for iraq and we have a plan for iraq
p3345
aVthey have a plan for iraq too more of the same
p3346
aVwe have a plan for success and that plan includ speed up the train of the militari we have less than half of the staff that we need there to complet that train
p3347
aVthe effort that we ve mount with respect to iraq focus specif on the possibl that this was the most like nexus between the terrorist and weapon of mass destruct
p3348
aVsecond make sure that the reconstruct is sped up in a way that the iraqi see some tangibl benefit for what s happen
p3349
aVand by the way if we need to we can take iraqi out of iraq to train them it is not secur enough it s so danger on the ground that they can t be train there we can take them out of iraq for purpos of train
p3350
aVwe should do whatev has to be done to train the iraqi and to speed up that process
p3351
aVthat work in conjunct with make sure the elect take place on time
p3352
aVright now the unit nation which is respons for the elect in januari has about 35 peopl there now that s compar with a much smaller countri like east timor where they had over 200 peopl on the ground
p3353
aVyou need more than 35 peopl to hold an elect in cleveland much less in iraq
p3354
aVand they keep say the elect s on schedul this is go to happen
p3355
aVthe realiti is we need a new presid with credibl with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success success breed contribut breed join the coalit
p3356
aVnot onli that i want to go back to what the vice presid said he attack us about the troop they sent 40 000 american troop into iraq without the bodi armor they need they sent them without the armor vehicl they need while they were on the ground fight they lobbi the congress to cut their combat pay this is the height of hypocrisi
p3357
aVthe biggest threat we face today is the possibl of terrorist smuggl a nuclear weapon or a biolog agent into one of our own citi and threaten the live of hundr of thousand of american
p3358
aVcheney well gwen it s hard to know where to start there are so mani inaccuraci there
p3359
aVthe fact of the matter is the troop wouldn t have what they have today if you guy had had your way
p3360
aVyou talk about internation the effort they don t have a plan basic it s an echo
p3361
aVyou made the comment that the gulf war coalit in 91 was far stronger than this no we had 34 countri then we ve got 30 today we ve got troop besid us
p3362
aVit s hard after john kerri refer to our alli as a coalit of the coerc and the bribe to go out and persuad peopl to send troop and to particip in this process
p3363
aVyou end up with a situat in which talk about demean in effect you demean the sacrific of our alli when you say it s the wrong war wrong place wrong time and oh by the way send troop
p3364
aVmake no sens at all it s total inconsist there isn t a plan there
p3365
aVour most import alli in the war on terror in iraq specif is prime minist allawi he came recent and address a joint session of congress that i presid over with the speaker of the hous
p3366
aVand john kerri rush out immedi after his speech was over with where he came and he thank america for our contribut and our sacrific and pledg to hold those elect in januari went out and demean him critic him challeng his credibl
p3367
aVwhat we did in iraq was exact the right thing to do if i had it to recommend all over again i would recommend exact the same cours of action the world is far safer today becaus saddam hussein is in jail his govern is no longer in power and we did exact the right thing
p3368
aVedward thank you
p3369
aVthe vice presid suggest that we have the same number of countri involv now that we had in the first gulf war the first gulf war cost the american peopl 5 billion
p3370
aVand regardless of what the vice presid say we re at 200 billion and count not onli that 90 percent of the coalit casualti mr vice presid the coalit casualti are american casualti nineti percent of the cost of this effort are be born by american taxpay it is the direct result of the failur of this administr
p3371
aVcheney classic exampl he won t count the sacrific and the contribut of iraqi alli it s their countri they re in the fight they re increas the one out there put their neck on the line to take back their countri from the terrorist and the old regim element that are still left they re do a superb job and for you to demean their sacrific strike me as
p3372
aVedward oh i m not
p3373
aVcheney as beyond
p3374
aVedward i m not demean
p3375
aVcheney it is inde you suggest
p3376
aVedward no sir i did not
p3377
aVcheney somehow they shouldn t count becaus you want to be abl to say that the american are take 90 percent of the sacrific you cannot succeed in this effort if you re not will to recogn the enorm contribut the iraqi are increas make to their own futur
p3378
aVwe ll win when they take on respons for govern which they re do and when the take on respons for their own secur which they increas are do
p3379
aVedward thank
p3380
aVedward well let me speak first of all to what the vice presid just said and then i ll answer that question
p3381
aVthis unfortun what the vice presid is tell peopl is inconsist with everyth they see everi singl day it s a continu of well there s a strong connect between al qaida and saddam hussein
p3382
aVit s not true it s a continu of at least insinu that there s some connect between 9 11 and saddam hussein it s not true
p3383
aVedward thank you
p3384
aVit s say to the american peopl as the presid said last thursday and the vice presid continu to say tonight that thing are go well in iraq contrari to what peopl who have been there have seen includ republican leader contrari to what everyon in america see on their televis everi day american be kidnap peopl be behead part of the countri under the control of insurg even today under the control of the insurg
p3385
aVthe vice presid has still not said anyth about what mr bremer said about the failur to have adequ troop the failur to be abl to secur the countri in the short term
p3386
aVyou know rememb shock and awe
p3387
aVlook at where we are now it is a direct result of the failur to plan the failur to have other involv in this effort this is not an accid
p3388
aVnow let me go back to your question
p3389
aVif we want to do the thing that need to be done to keep this countri safe we can t be drag kick and scream to it
p3390
aVone thing that everybodi doe agre on is that 9 11 did chang thing
p3391
aVbut what s happen is this administr oppos the creation of a 9 11 commiss to find out whi it happen and what we need to do
p3392
aVthey oppos the creation of a depart of homeland secur and then they were for it
p3393
aVwe can t react that way we must be more aggress
p3394
aVthank you gwen for moder this debat thank you to the folk of case western and all the peopl in ohio for have us here
p3395
aVwith john kerri as presid of the unit state we are commit to immedi implement all of the reform suggest by the 9 11 commiss so that we have the inform we need to find terrorist and crush them befor hey hurt us
p3396
aVmr vice presid you are still not be straight with the american peopl i mean the realiti you and georg bush continu to tell peopl first that thing are go well in iraq the american peopl don t need us to explain this to them they see it on their televis everi singl day we lost more troop in septemb than we lost in august lost more in august than we lost in juli lost more in juli than we lost in june
p3397
aVcheney no i do not and gwen at the time i was talk specif about this question of unilater sanction
p3398
aVwhat happen when we impos unilater sanction is unless there s a collect effort then other peopl move in and take advantag of the situat and you don t have ani impact except to penal american compani
p3399
aVwe ve got sanction on iran now we may well want to go to the u n secur council and ask for even tougher sanction if they don t live up to their oblig under the initi intern atom energi agenc non prolifer treati
p3400
aVwe dealt with iran differ than we have iraq part becaus iran has not yet as iraq did violat 12 year of resolut by the u n secur council
p3401
aVwe re work with the brit and the german and the french who ve been negoti with the iranian
p3402
aVwe recent were activ involv in a meet with the board of governor in the intern atom energi agenc and as i say there will be a follow up meet in novemb to determin whether or not iran s live up to their commit and oblig
p3403
aVand if they aren t my guess is then the board of governor will recommend send the whole matter to the u n secur council for the applic of the intern sanction which i think would be exact the right way to go
p3404
aVwe re address north korea on a similar basi work with the chines the south korean the japanes and other to tri to bring them around
p3405
aVone of the great by product for exampl of what we did in iraq and afghanistan is that five day after we captur saddam hussein moammar gadhafi in libya came forward and announc that he was go to surrend all of his nuclear materi to the unit state which he has done
p3406
aVthis was one of the biggest sourc of prolifer in the world today in term of the threat that was repres by that the supplier network that provid that head by mr a q khan has been shut down
p3407
aVthe truth is our men and women in uniform have been heroic our militari has done everyth they ve been ask to do
p3408
aVwe ve made major progress in deal here with a major issu with respect to nuclear prolifer and we ll continu to press veri hard on the north korean and the iranian as well
p3409
aVedward well the vice presid talk about there be a member or someon associ with al qaida in iraq there are 60 countri who have member of al qaida in them
p3410
aVhow mani of those countri are we go to invad
p3411
aVnot onli that he talk about iran the realiti about iran is that iran has move forward with their nuclear weapon program on their watch they cede respons to deal with it to the european
p3412
aVnow the vice presid as you point out spoke out loud for lift the sanction on iraq john kerri and i believ we need to strengthen the sanction on iraq includ close the loophol that allow compani to use a subsidiari offshor subsidiari to do busi with iran
p3413
aVi mention halliburton a few minut ago in connect with the 87 billion and you rais it in this question this is relev becaus he was push for lift sanction when he was ceo of halliburton here s whi we didn t think halliburton should have a no bid contract
p3414
aVwhile he was ceo of halliburton they paid million of dollar in fine for provid fals inform on their compani just like enron and ken lay
p3415
aVthey did busi with libya and iran two sworn enemi of the unit state
p3416
aVthey re now under investig for have bribe foreign offici dure that period of time
p3417
aVand it s not just me that see the mess in iraq there are republican leader like john mccain like richard lugar like chuck hagel who have said iraq is a mess and it s get wors and when they were ask whi richard lugar said becaus of the incompet of the administr
p3418
aVnot onli that they ve gotten a 7 5 billion no bid contract in iraq and instead of part of their money be withheld which is the way it s normal done becaus they re under investig they ve continu to get their money
p3419
aVcheney i can respond gwen but it s go to take more than 30 second
p3420
aVcheney well the reason they keep mention halliburton is becaus they re tri to throw up a smokescreen they know the charg are fals
p3421
aVthey know that if you go for exampl to factcheck com sic an independ web site sponsor by the univers of pennsylvania you can get the specif detail with respect to halliburton
p3422
aVit s an effort that they ve made repeat to tri to confus the voter and to rais question but there s no substanc to the charg
p3423
aVedward these are the fact
p3424
aVwhat paul bremer said yesterday is they didn t have enough troop to secur the countri they also didn t have a plan to win the peac they also didn t put the allianc togeth to make this success
p3425
aVthe fact are the vice presid s compani that he was ceo of that did busi with sworn enemi of the unit state paid million of dollar in fine for provid fals financi inform it s under investig for bribe foreign offici
p3426
aVthe same compani that got a 7 5 billion no bid contract the rule is that part of their money is suppos to be withheld when they re under investig as they are now for have overcharg the american taxpay but they re get everi dime of their money
p3427
aVi m happi to let voter make their own decis about this
p3428
aVedward well first of all i do agre that we ve been larg absent not entir absent but larg absent from the peac make process over the last four year
p3429
aVand let me just say a coupl of preliminari thing and then talk about where we are now
p3430
aVwe need a fresh start we need a presid who will speed up the train of the iraqi get more staff in for do that we need to speed up the reconstruct so the iraqi see some tangibl benefit we need a new presid who has the credibl which john kerri has to bring other into this effort
p3431
aVfirst the isra peopl not onli have the right to defend themselv they should defend themselv they have an oblig to defend themselv
p3432
aVi mean if i can just for a moment tell you a person stori i was in jerusalem a coupl of year ago actual three year ago in august of 2001 stay at the king david hotel
p3433
aVwe left in the morn head to the airport to leav and later in the day i found out that that same day not far from where we were stay the sbarro pizzeria was hit by a suicid bomber in jerusalem fifteen peopl were kill six children were kill
p3434
aVwhat are the isra peopl suppos to do how can they continu to watch isra children kill by suicid bomber kill by terrorist
p3435
aVthey have not onli the right to the oblig to defend themselv
p3436
aVnow we know that the prime minist has made a decis an histor decis to unilater withdraw from gaza it s import for america to particip in help with that process
p3437
aVnow if gaza s be use as a platform for attack the isra peopl that has to be stop and israel has a right to defend itself they don t have a partner for peac right now they certain don t have a partner in arafat and they need a legitim partner for peac
p3438
aVand i might add it is veri import for america to crack down on the saudi who have not had a public prosecut for financ terror sinc 9 11
p3439
aVand it s import for america to confront the situat in iran becaus iran is an enorm threat to israel and to the isra peopl
p3440
aVcheney gwen i want to go back to the last comment and then i ll come back to israel palestin
p3441
aVthe reason they keep tri to attack halliburton is becaus they want to obscur their own record
p3442
aVand senat frank you have a record in the senat that s not veri distinguish you ve miss 33 out of 36 meet in the judiciari committe almost 70 percent of the meet of the intellig committe
p3443
aVyou ve miss a lot of key vote on tax polici on energi on medicar reform
p3444
aVyour hometown newspap has taken to call you senat gone you ve got one of the worst attend record in the unit state senat
p3445
aVnow in my capac as vice presid i am the presid of senat the presid offic i m up in the senat most tuesday when they re in session
p3446
aVthe first time i ever met you was when you walk on the stage tonight
p3447
aVin respect to israel and palestin gwen the suicid bomber in part were generat by saddam hussein who paid 25 000 to the famili of suicid bomber
p3448
aVi person think one of the reason that we don t have as mani suicid attack today in israel as we ve had in the past is becaus saddam is no longer in busi
p3449
aVwe ve been strong support of israel the presid step forward and put in place a polici basic that said we will support the establish of two state first presid ever to say we ll establish and support a palestinian state nextdoor to isra
p3450
aVcheney we ve made signific progress in iraq we ve stood up a new govern that s been in power now onli 90 day the notion of addit troop is talk about frequent but the point of success in iraq will be reach when we have turn govern over to the iraqi peopl they have been abl to establish a democrat govern they re well on their way to do that they will have free elect next januari for the first time in histori
p3451
aVbut first there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with and we won t have that we don t have it now in a yasser arafat there has to be reform of the palestinian system
p3452
aVedward that was a complet distort of my record i know that won t come as a shock
p3453
aVthe vice presid i m surpris to hear him talk about record when he was one of 435 member of the unit state hous he was one of 10 to vote against head start one of four to vote against ban plastic weapon that can pass through metal detector
p3454
aVhe vote against the depart of educ he vote against fund for meal on wheel for senior he vote against a holiday for martin luther king he vote against a resolut call for the releas of nelson mandela in south africa
p3455
aVit s amaz to hear him critic either my record or john kerri s
p3456
aVcheney oh i think his record speak for itself and frank it s not veri distinguish
p3457
aVwe also are activ rapid train iraqi to take on the secur respons
p3458
aVcheney i think it goe to senat edward
p3459
aVcheney i conced the point
p3460
aVlaughter
p3461
aVedward no i did talk about it israel he s the one who didn t talk about it
p3462
aVcheney well gwen there are sever thing that i think need to be done and are be done
p3463
aVwe ve of cours been through a difficult recess and then the aftermath of 9 11 where we lost over a million job after that attack but we think the key is to address some basic fundament issu that the presid s alreadi work on
p3464
aVi think probabl the most success thing we can do with respect to end poverti is to get peopl job there s no better antidot to poverti than a good well pay job that allow somebodi to take care of their own famili
p3465
aVthose two step are crucial to success in iraq they re well in hand well under way and i m confid that in fact we ll get the job done
p3466
aVto do that we have to make america the best place in the world to do busi and that mean we ve got to deal effect with tax polici we ve got to reduc the litig cost that are built into our societi we ve got to provid the adequ medic care and make certain that we can in fact creat the opportun that are vital to that process
p3467
aVi d zero in in particular on educ i think the most import thing we can do is have a first class public school system i m a product of public school
p3468
aVand the presid his first legisl prioriti was the no child left behind act it was the first piec of legisl we introduc
p3469
aVwe got it pass that first summer on a bipartisan basi we even had ted kennedi on board for the effort
p3470
aVand it doe sever thing it establish high standard it at the same time set up a system of test with respect to our school system so we can establish account to parent and make certain that they understand how well their student are do and they have the opportun to move student out of poor perform school to good school
p3471
aVit strike me that that is absolut the heart of what need to be done from the standpoint of educ
p3472
aVit s also import as we go forward in the next term we want to be abl to take what we ve done for elementari educ and move it into the secondari educ
p3473
aVit s work we ve seen report now of a reduct in the achiev gap between major student and minor student we re make signific progress
p3474
aVedward gwen your question was about job
p3475
aVedward i thought it was about job and poverti i hope we get a chanc to talk about educ but that s what the vice presid talk about
p3476
aVhere s what s happen in the time that they have been in offic in the last four year 1 6 million privat sector job have been lost 2 7 million manufactur job have been lost and it s had real consequ in place like cleveland
p3477
aVcleveland is a wonder distinguish citi that s done a lot of great thing but it has the highest poverti rate in the countri one out of almost two children in cleveland are now live in poverti
p3478
aVdure the time that the vice presid and the presid have been in offic 4 million more american have fallen into poverti
p3479
aVdure the time that the vice presid and the presid have been in offic 4 million more american have fallen into poverti
p3480
aVand what the most strike and startl thing is they are the first presid in 70 year and i m talk democrat republican presid who led us through world war through the korean war the vietnam war cold war everi one of them creat job until this presid
p3481
aVwe have to do better we have a plan we re go to get rid of by the way they re for outsourc job i want to make sure peopl hear that the fundament differ with us the administr say over and over that the outsourc of million of american job is good we re against it
p3482
aVwe want to get rid of tax cut for compani send job oversea we want to balanc this budget get back to fiscal respons and we want to invest in the creativ innov job of the futur
p3483
aVedward yes
p3484
aVcheney gwen we ve got 111 million american taxpay that have benefit from our incom tax cut
p3485
aVwe ve got 33 million student who ve benefit from no child left behind
p3486
aVwe ve got 40 million senior who benefit from the reform of the medicar system the democrat promis prescript drug benefit for year they ve run on that platform they never got it done the presid got it done
p3487
aVwe also drop 5 million peopl total off the feder incom tax roll so they no longer have to pay ani feder incom tax at all
p3488
aVso the stori i think is a good one
p3489
aVand the data he s use is old data it s from 2003 it doesn t includ ani of the gain that we ve made in the last year we ve ad 1 7 million job to the economi
p3490
aVedward the vice presid and presid like to talk about their experi on the campaign trail million of peopl have lost their job million have fallen into poverti famili incom are down while the cost of everyth is go up
p3491
aVmedic cost are up the highest they ve ever been over the last four year we have this mess in iraq
p3492
aVmr vice presid i don t think the countri can take four more year of this kind of experi
p3493
aVmr vice presid there is no connect between the attack of septemb 11th and saddam hussein the 9 11 commiss has said it your own secretari of state has said it and you ve gone around the countri suggest that there is some connect there is not
p3494
aVedward becaus we will do what they ve not done you know if you look at what s happen over the last four year we have gone from a 5 trillion project surplus when georg bush took offic to a 3 trillion project deficit
p3495
aVthey promis they were go to put 2 trillion of the surplus asid from social secur not done
p3496
aVnot onli that it s the biggest fiscal turnaround in american histori
p3497
aVand there s no end in sight the washington post just report they have sever trillion dollar of addit tax cut and spend no suggest of what they re go to do about it
p3498
aVjohn kerri and i believ we have a moral respons not to leav trillion of debt to our children and our grandchildren
p3499
aVso here s what we re go to do to answer you question
p3500
aVto pay for the thing that we believ need to be done and i hope to get the chanc to talk about health care and also about educ becaus we have plan on both of those subject what we re go to do is roll back tax cut
p3501
aVand i want everyon to hear this becaus there have been exagger made on the campaign trail roll back tax cut for peopl who make over 200 000 a year we will do that
p3502
aVand in fact the cia is now about to report that the connect between al qaida and saddam hussein is tenuous at best and in fact the secretari of defens said yesterday that he know of no hard evid of the connect
p3503
aVwe want to keep the tax cut that are in place for peopl who make less than 200 000 a year and give addit tax cut to those middl class famili tax cut for health care tax cut to help famili pay for their colleg tuition tax cut for child care
p3504
aVthese famili are struggl and hurt and they need more tax relief not less tax relief
p3505
aVbut to help get us back on the path to a balanc budget we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucrat spend in washington
p3506
aVone of the amaz thing that s happen is they ve actual layer on more supervisori peopl peopl at the supervisori level in this govern
p3507
aVwe also want to close some corpor loophol
p3508
aVnow i want to be honest with peopl we can t elimin this deficit peopl have heard that over and over and over in four year we cannot do it we re in too deep a hole
p3509
aVbut we can cut the deficit in half and if we move we can move this countri back on a path to fiscal respons
p3510
aVcheney gwen the kerri record on tax is one basic of vote for a larg number of tax increas 98 time in the unit state senat
p3511
aVthere s a fundament philosoph differ here between the presid and myself who believ that we ought to let the american peopl keep more of what they earn and we ought to empow them to have more control over their own live i think the kerri edward approach basic is to rais tax and to give govern more control over the live of individu citizen
p3512
aVwe need to be straight with the american peopl
p3513
aVwe think that s the wrong way to go there s a fundament differ of opinion here
p3514
aVthey talk about the top bracket and go after onli those peopl in the top bracket
p3515
aVwell the fact of the matter is a great mani of our small busi pay tax under the person incom tax rather than the corpor rate and about 900 000 small busi will be hit if you do in fact do what they want to do with the top bracket
p3516
aVthat s not smart becaus seven out of 10 new job in america are creat by small busi
p3517
aVyou do not want to tax them it s a bad idea to increas the burden on those folk
p3518
aVthe senat himself said dure the cours of the primari that the kerri plan would drive us deeper into deficit those were the senat s word about his run mate
p3519
aVthe fact of the matter is the presid and i will go forward to make the tax cut perman that s good polici that s what we ought to do but with fiscal restraint we ll also drive the deficit down 50 percent in the cours of the next five year
p3520
aVedward we are commit to cut back anyth in our program that need to be cut back to get us back on a path to fiscal respons
p3521
aVjohn kerri mr vice presid has vote or co sponsor over 600 time tax cut for the american peopl over 600 time
p3522
aVand there is a philosoph differ between us and them
p3523
aVwe are for more tax cut for the middl class than they re for have been for the last four year but we are not for more tax cut for multimillionair they are
p3524
aVand it is a fundament differ in what we think need to be done in this countri
p3525
aVcheney yesterday the presid sign an extens of middl class tax cut the 10 percent bracket the marriag penalti relief and the increas in the child tax credit
p3526
aVsenat kerri and edward weren t even there to vote for it when it came to final passag
p3527
aVcheney gwen you re right four year ago in this debat the subject came up and i said then and i believ today that freedom doe mean freedom for everybodi peopl ought to be free to choos ani arrang they want it s realli no one els s busi
p3528
aVthat s a separ question from the issu of whether or not govern should sanction or approv or give some sort of author if you will to these relationship
p3529
aVtradit that s been an issu for the state state have regul marriag if you will that would be my prefer
p3530
aVin effect what s happen is that in recent month especi in massachusett but also in california but in massachusett we had the massachusett suprem court direct the state of the legislatur of massachusett to modifi their constitut to allow gay marriag
p3531
aVand the fact is that the presid felt that it was import to make it clear that that s the wrong way to go as far as he s concern
p3532
aVnow he set the polici for this administr and i support the presid
p3533
aVedward yes let me say first on an issu that the vice presid said in his last answer befor we got to this question talk about tax polici the countri need to know that under what they have put in place and want to put in place a millionair sit by their swim pool collect their statement to see how much money they re make make their money from dividend pay a lower tax rate than the men and women who are receiv paycheck for serv on the ground in iraq
p3534
aVnow they may think that s right john kerri and i do not
p3535
aVwe don t just valu wealth which they do we valu work in this countri and it is a fundament valu differ between them and us
p3536
aVnow as to this question let me say first that i think the vice presid and his wife love their daughter i think they love her veri much and you can t have anyth but respect for the fact that they re will to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter the fact that they embrac her it s a wonder thing and there are million of parent like that who love their children who want their children to be happi
p3537
aVand i believ that marriag is between a man and a woman and so doe john kerri
p3538
aVi also believ that there should be partnership benefit for gay and lesbian coupl in long term commit relationship
p3539
aVbut we should not use the constitut to divid this countri
p3540
aVno state for the last 200 year has ever had to recogn anoth state s marriag
p3541
aVthis is use the constitut as a polit tool and it s wrong
p3542
aVedward no i think we ve both said the same thing all along
p3543
aVwe both believ that and this goe onto the end of what i just talk about we both believ that marriag is between a man and a woman
p3544
aVedward here s what it mean it mean that saddam hussein need to be confront john kerri and i have consist said that that s whi we vote for the resolut but it also mean it need to be done the right way
p3545
aVbut we also believ that gay and lesbian and gay and lesbian coupl those who have been in long term relationship deserv to be treat respect they deserv to have benefit
p3546
aVfor exampl a gay coupl now has a veri difficult time one visit the other when they re in the hospit or for exampl if heaven forbid one of them were to pass away they have troubl even arrang the funer
p3547
aVi mean those are not the kind of thing that john kerri and i believ in i suspect the vice presid himself doe not believ in that
p3548
aVbut we don t we do believ that marriag should be between a man and a woman
p3549
aVand i want to go back if i can to the question you just ask which is this constitut amend
p3550
aVi want to make sure peopl understand that the presid is propos a constitut amend to ban gay marriag that is complet unnecessari
p3551
aVunder the law of this countri for the last 200 year no state has been requir to recogn anoth state s marriag
p3552
aVlet me just be simpl about this my state of north carolina would not be requir to recogn a marriag from massachusett which you just ask about
p3553
aVthere is absolut no purpos in the law and in realiti for this amend it s noth but a polit tool and it s be use in an effort to divid this countri on an issu that we should not be divid america on
p3554
aVwe ought to be talk about issu like health care and job and what s happen in iraq not use an issu to divid this countri in a way that s sole for polit purpos it s wrong
p3555
aVand do it the right way meant that we were prepar that we gave the weapon inspector time to find out what we now know that in fact there were no weapon of mass destruct that we didn t take our eye off the ball which are al qaida osama bin laden the peopl who attack us on septemb the 11th now rememb we went into afghanistan which by the way was the right thing to do that was the right decis and our militari perform terrif there
p3556
aVcheney well gwen let me simpli thank the senat for the kind word he said about my famili and our daughter i appreci that veri much
p3557
aVcheney that s it
p3558
aVcheney well gwen
p3559
aVlaughter cheney first of all i m not familiar with his case my concern is specif with what s happen to our medic care system becaus of rise malpractic insur rate becaus we fail to adequ reform our medic liabil structur
p3560
aVbut we had osama bin laden corner at tora bora we had the 10th mountain divis up in uzbekistan avail we had the finest militari in the world on the ground and what did we do
p3561
aVi was in new mexico the other day and met with a group of ob gyn doc
p3562
aVand they were deepli concern becaus they were fear that there d be anoth increas in malpractic insur rate as a result of what they believ are frivol lawsuit and that that would put them out of busi
p3563
aVand one doctor indic that her rate have gone up so much that she s now to the point where she is screen patient she won t take high risk patient anymor becaus of the danger that that will generat a lawsuit and a lawsuit will put her out of busi
p3564
aVthis has had a devast impact in a lot of communiti my home state of wyom we ve lost the top insur of malpractic insur in the state the rate for a general practition have gone from 40 000 a year to 100 000 a year for an insur polici
p3565
aVwe think this has a devast impact on the qualiti of health care
p3566
aVas i say high risk patient don t get cover anymor we ve lost one out of eleven ob gyn practition in the countri we think it can be fix need to be fix
p3567
aVnow specif what we need to do is cap non econom damag and we also think you need to limit the award that the trial attorney take out of all of this over 50 percent of the settlement go to the attorney and for administr overhead
p3568
aVwe pass medic liabil reform through the hous of repres it s been block in the senat senat kerri s vote 10 time against medic liabil reform and i don t believ senat edward support it either not the kind that would be meaning
p3569
aVedward yes well let me say first of all i m proud of the work i did on behalf of kid and famili against big insur compani big drug compani and big hmos
p3570
aVwe turn this is the man who mastermind the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in american histori and what did the administr decid to do
p3571
aVwe do have too mani lawsuit and the realiti is there s someth that we can do about it
p3572
aVjohn kerri and i have a plan to do someth about it we want to put more respons on the lawyer to requir befor a case malpractic which the vice presid just spoke about have the case review by independ expert to determin if the case is serious and meritori befor it can be file hold the lawyer respons for that certifi that and hold the lawyer financi respons if they don t do it have a three strike and you re out rule so that a lawyer who file three of these case without meet this requir lose their right to file these case
p3573
aVthat way we keep the case out of the system that don t belong in the system they talk about frivol case we believ case that don t belong in the system should never be in the system
p3574
aVbut we don t believ that we should take away the right of peopl like valeri lakey who was the young girl who i repres five year old sever injur for life on a defect swim pool drain cover
p3575
aVit turn out the compani knew of 12 other children who had either been kill or sever injur by the same problem they hid it they didn t tell anybodi they could have fix it with a 2 cent screw that s wrong
p3576
aVjohn kerri and i are alway go to stand with the valeri lakey of the world and not with the insur compani
p3577
aVedward am i person attack
p3578
aVi think the truth is that what they re do is talk about an issu that realli doesn t have a great deal to do with what s happen with medic polici in this countri which i think is a veri serious issu
p3579
aVand i would be the first to say that what the vice presid describ a few minut ago problem with malpractic premium that s true it s real it s veri real what doctor talk about is veri serious
p3580
aVthey gave the respons of captur and or kill saddam i mean osama bin laden to afghan warlord who just a few week befor had been work with osama bin laden
p3581
aVand they re get squeez from both side i mean becaus they have troubl get reimburs first of all for the care that they provid you know from the govern or from health care compani and on the flip side their malpractic cost are go up
p3582
aVthat s veri real which is whi we have propos a plan to keep case out of the system that don t belong there
p3583
aVbut it s veri import to put this in context becaus in context everyth they re propos accord to the bipartisan congression budget offic amount to about half of 1 percent of health care cost in this countri half of 1 percent
p3584
aVwe have doubl digit inflat in health care cost we ve seen the largest rise in medic cost in the last four year in the countri s histori 3 500 nation and nobodi who s watch this debat need me to explain this to them they know it
p3585
aVmedicar premium are up 17 percent on their watch again largest increas in medicar premium in the histori of medicar
p3586
aVwe think we have a plan to keep case that don t belong in the system out but we also do what they haven t done
p3587
aVfive million american have lost their health care coverag medic cost are skyrocket we have a serious health care plan to bring down cost for everybodi to cover million more american and to actual stand up to drug compani and insur compani which this administr has been unwil to do
p3588
aVcheney gwen we think lawsuit abus is a serious problem in this countri we think we bad need tort reform
p3589
aVi was in minnesota the other day where i visit an aircraft manufactur plant it s a great success stori this is a compani that start 20 year ago with noth today they re the second lead produc of piston driven aircraft in the countri
p3590
aVour point in this is not complic we were attack by al qaida and osama bin laden
p3591
aVhe told me that if it weren t for the increas cost of his liabil insur in this case product liabil he could hire 200 more peopl in his factori we ve built into the system enorm cost as a result of our practic with respect to litig we have to find way to get a handl on it
p3592
aVhe mention medicar up 17 percent somehow that that was someth we caus no the 17 percent increas in medicar premium was the direct result of a statut adopt in 1997 john kerri vote for it
p3593
aVit establish the formula for part b of medicar that say in effect it has to cover 25 percent of the cost of the program and the reason the money had to go into the trust fund was to make certain that we could cover those elig for benefit
p3594
aVwhile you were in privat practic in law and as a senat you had the advantag of a special tax loophol subchapt s corpor which you set up so you could avoid pay 600 000 in medicar tax that would have gone into the fund
p3595
aVand it s those kind of loophol that necessit a premium increas under the law that was enact in 1997 support by john kerri
p3596
aVedward well first of all i have paid all the tax that i owe
p3597
aVwhen the vice presid was ceo of halliburton they took advantag of everi offshor loophol avail they had multipl offshor compani that were avoid tax
p3598
aVthose are the kind of thing that ought to be close they ought to be close they ought to be close for anybodi they ought to be close whether they re person and they ought to be close whether they appli to a corpor
p3599
aVbut the realiti is health care cost are go up everi day for the american peopl and i hope we re go to get a chanc to talk more about health care
p3600
aVwe went into afghanistan and veri quick the administr made a decis to divert attent from that and instead began to plan for the invas of iraq
p3601
aVcheney we ve done a lot to reduc the cost of health care the medicar drug benefit that we ll be provid to senior begin in 06 will provid upward to 1 300 a year to help them buy prescript drug
p3602
aVthe drug save drug discount card that s now avail save an estim 15 percent to 30 percent off the cost of prescript drug for senior citizen
p3603
aVso we re move in as mani area as we can to make certain we hold down and reduc the health care cost
p3604
aVcheney well this is a great tragedi gwen when you think about the enorm cost here in the unit state and around the world of the aid epidem pandem realli million of live lost million more infect and face a veri bleak futur
p3605
aVin some part of the world we ve got the entir sort of product generat has been elimin as a result of aid all except for old folk and kid nobodi to do the basic work that run an economi
p3606
aVthe presid has been deepli concern about it he has move and propos and gotten through the congress author for 15 billion to help in the intern effort to be target in those place where we need to do everyth we can through a combin of educ as well as provid the kind of medicin that will help peopl control the infect
p3607
aVhere in the unit state we ve made signific progress i have not heard those number with respect to african american women i was not awar that it was that they re in epidem there becaus we have made progress in term of the overal rate of aid infect and i think primarili through a combin of educ and public awar as well as the develop as a result of research of drug that allow peopl to live longer live even though they are infect obvious we need to do more of that
p3608
aVand these connect i want the american peopl to hear this veri clear listen care to what the vice presid is say becaus there is no connect between saddam hussein and the attack of septemb 11th period
p3609
aVedward well first with respect to what s happen in africa and russia and in other place around the world the vice presid spoke about the 15 billion for aid john kerri and i believ that need to be doubl
p3610
aVand i might add on the first year of their commit they came up signific short of what they had promis
p3611
aVand we probabl won t get a chanc to talk about africa let me just say a coupl of thing
p3612
aVthe aid epidem in africa which is kill million and million of peopl and is a frighten thing not just for the peopl of africa but also for the rest of the world that combin with the genocid that we re now see in sudan are two huge moral issu for the unit state of america which john kerri spoke about eloqu last thursday night
p3613
aVhere at home we need to do much more and the vice presid spoke about do research make sure we have the drug avail make sure that we do everyth possibl to have prevent but it s a bigger question than that
p3614
aVyou know we have 5 million american who ve lost their health care coverag in the last four year 45 million american without health care coverag we have children who don t have health care coverag
p3615
aVif kid and adult don t have access to prevent care if they re not get the health care that they need day after day after day the possibl of not onli develop aid and have a problem have a problem a life threaten problem but the problem of develop other life threaten diseas is there everi day of their live
p3616
aVthe 9 11 commiss has said that s true colin powel has said it s true but the vice presid keep suggest that there is there is not and in fact ani connect with al qaida is tenuous at best
p3617
aVedward the american peopl want in their presid and in their vice presid basic three thing they want to know that their presid and their vice presid will keep them safe they want to know that they have good judgment and they want to know that you ll tell them the truth
p3618
aVjohn kerri and i will tell the american peopl the truth
p3619
aVdure the time that i have serv on the intellig committe in the senat travel to some of the place we ve talk about tonight afghanistan pakistan the middl east turkey meet with the leader of nato i have a veri clear idea of what has to be done to keep this countri safe
p3620
aVthe threat we face terror kill terrorist and stop them befor they can do damag to us make sure that we stop the spread of nuclear weapon
p3621
aVi agre with john kerri from thursday night that the danger of nuclear weapon get in the hand of terrorist is one of the greatest threat that america face
p3622
aVbut the one thing that we know from this administr is and i first of all i don t claim to have the long polit resum that vice presid cheney has that s just the truth and the american peopl know that and deserv to know it but what we know from this administr is that a long resum doe not equal good judgment
p3623
aVhere are the judgment i would make my first prioriti would be to keep this countri safe i would find terrorist where they are and stop them and kill them befor they do harm to us
p3624
aVwe would stop the spread of nuclear weapon
p3625
aVand we would also strengthen this militari which mean provid the equip and train that they need
p3626
aVcheney you want me to answer a question about his qualif
p3627
aVcheney i see
p3628
aVwell i think the import thing in pick a vice presid probabl vari from presid to presid differ presid approach it in differ way
p3629
aVwhen georg bush ask me to sign on it obvious wasn t becaus he was worri about carri wyom we got 70 percent of the vote in wyom although those three elector vote turn out to be pretti import last time around
p3630
aVwhat he said he want me to do was to sign on becaus of my experi to be a member of the team to help him govern and that s exact the way he s use me
p3631
aVand i think from the perspect of the nation it s work in our relationship in this administr i think it s work in part becaus i made it clear that i don t have ani further polit aspir myself and i think that s been an advantag
p3632
aVi think it allow the presid to know that my onli agenda is his agenda i m not worri about what some precinct committeemen in iowa were think of me with respect to the next round of caucus of 2008
p3633
aVcheney the senat has got his fact wrong i have not suggest there s a connect between iraq and 9 11 but there s clear an establish iraqi track record with terror
p3634
aVit s a veri signific respons when you consid that at a moment s notic you may have to take over as presid of the unit state and make all of those decis it s happen sever time in our histori
p3635
aVand i think that probabl is the most import consider in pick a vice presid somebodi who could take over
p3636
aVedward i think the most import thing i ve learn from this process is what i now know about john kerri i knew him befor i know him better now
p3637
aVhe s the one candid who s led troop in battl he was a prosecutor put peopl behind bar to protect neighborhood from crime he fought for 100 000 cop on the street and went with john mccain to vietnam to find out what happen to our pow
p3638
aVand the american peopl saw for themselv on thursday night the strength resolv and backbon that i myself have seen in john kerri
p3639
aVcheney well i clear believ that georg w bush would be a better command in chief he s alreadi done it for four year
p3640
aVand he s demonstr without question the convict the vision the determin to win this war against terror he understand it s a global conflict that reach from the unit state all the way around the globe to jakarta
p3641
aVand those veri special qualiti are vital in a command in chief and i think the presid has them and i m not at all convinc his oppon doe
p3642
aVand the point is that that s the place where you re most like to see the terrorist come togeth with weapon of mass destruct the dead technolog that saddam hussein had develop and use over the year
p3643
aVcheney whi i am differ from john edward well in some respect i think probabl there are more similar than there are differ in our person stori
p3644
aVi don t talk about myself veri much but i ve heard senat edward and as i listen to him i find some similar
p3645
aVi come from relat modest circumst my grandfath never even went to high school i m the first in my famili to graduat from colleg
p3646
aVi carri a ticket in the intern brotherhood of electr worker for six year i ve been laid off been hospit without health insur so i have some idea of the problem that peopl encount
p3647
aVso i think the person stori are in some respect surpris similar
p3648
aVwith respect to how we ve spent our career i obvious made a choic for public servic and i ve been at it for a good long time now except for those period when we lost elect and that goe with the turf as well too
p3649
aVi m absolut convinc that the threat we face now the idea of a terrorist in the middl of one of our citi with a nuclear weapon is veri real and that we have to use extraordinari measur to deal with it
p3650
aVi feel veri strong that the signific of 9 11 cannot be underestim it forc us to think in new way about strategi about nation secur about how we structur our forc and about how we use u s militari power
p3651
aVnow the fact of the matter is the big differ here gwen is they are not prepar to deal with state that sponsor terror they ve got a veri limit view about how to use u s militari forc to defend america
p3652
aVsome peopl say we should wait until we are attack befor we use forc i would argu we ve alreadi been attack we lost more peopl on 9 11 than we lost at pearl harbor and i m a veri strong advoc of a veri aggress polici of go after the terrorist and those who support terror
p3653
aVedward mr vice presid we were attack but we weren t attack by saddam hussein and one thing that john kerri and i would agre with you about is that it is
p3654
aVedward oh i m sorri i broke the rule
p3655
aVone thing that we agre about is the need to be offens in go after terrorist
p3656
aVthe realiti is that the best defens is a good offens which mean lead america return to it proud tradit of the last 75 year of onc again lead strong coalit so we can get at these terrorist cell where they are befor they can do damag to us and to the american peopl
p3657
aVjohn kerri made clear on thursday night that i m sorri i broke the rule we made clear we made clear on thursday night that we will do that and we will do it aggress
p3658
aVbut there are thing that need to be done to keep this countri safe that have not yet been done
p3659
aVfor exampl three year after 9 11 we find out that the administr still doe not have a unifi terrorist watch list it s amaz three year what are we wait for you know we still don t have one list that everyon can work off of to see if terrorist are enter this countri
p3660
aVwe heard senat kerri say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test befor u s troop are deploy preemptiv to protect the unit state that s part of a track record that goe back to the 1970s when he ran for congress the first time and said troop should not be deploy without u n approv then in the mid 80s he ran on the basi of cut most of our major defens program in 1991 he vote against desert storm
p3661
aVwe re screen our passeng go onto airplan but we don t screen the cargo
p3662
aVthere are so mani thing that could be done to keep this countri safe
p3663
aVyou have to be strong and you have to be aggress but we also have to be smart and there are thing that have not been done that need to be done to keep the american peopl safe
p3664
aVcheney no
p3665
aVedward well first of all let me say that john kerri has i can use his name now
p3666
aVit s a consist pattern over time of alway be on the wrong side of defens issu
p3667
aVedward ok john kerri has been as have i been complet consist about iraq we ve made veri clear from the begin and not an afterthought we said it at the time that we had to confront saddam hussein and that we had to have a coalit and a plan to be success
p3668
aVand the vice presid didn t say much about it in your earlier question but paul bremer has now made clear that they didn t have enough troop and they didn t have a plan
p3669
aVand the american peopl are see the result of that everi singl day in spite of the proud and courag servic of our men and women in uniform
p3670
aVnow flip flop they should know someth about flip flop they ve seen a lot of it dure their administr
p3671
aVthey were first against the 9 11 commiss then they were for it they were for a depart of homeland secur i mean they were against the depart of homeland secur then they were for it
p3672
aVthey said they were go to put 2 trillion of the surplus when they came into offic asid to protect social secur then they chang their mind they said that they support the troop and then while our troop were on the ground in iraq and afghanistan they went to the congress and lobbi to have their combat pay cut
p3673
aVthey said that they were go to do someth about health care in this countri and they ve done someth they ve made it wors
p3674
aVthey said that they were go to fund their no child left behind 27 billion short today
p3675
aVover and over this administr has said one thing and done anoth
p3676
aVa littl tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidenti debat cannot obscur a record of 30 year of be on the wrong side of defens issu
p3677
aVthis presid said i listen to him the other night at his 2000 debat say i m for a nation patient bill of right
p3678
aVi know someth about this john mccain and senat kennedi and i wrote it got it pass in the senat we don t have a patient bill of right becaus of one man today the presid of the unit state they ve gone back and forth
p3679
aVedward yes but they didn t fund the mandat that they put on the school all over this countri that s the reason 800 teacher one of the reason 800 teacher have been laid off right here in cleveland one third of our public school are fail under this administr half of african american are drop out of high school half of hispan american are drop out of high school
p3680
aVand they give absolut no indic base on that record of be wile to go forward and aggress pursu the war on terror with a kind of strategi that will work that will defeat our enemi and will guarante that the unit state doesn t again get attack by the like of al qaida
p3681
aVjohn and i have and i don t have the time now but we have a clear plan to improv our public school that start with get our best teacher into the school where we need them the most by creat incent for them to go there
p3682
aVcheney gwen no child left behind they were for it now they re against it they vote for it now they re oppos to it
p3683
aVwe are make signific progress there we are close the achiev gap the result come in from a number of studi show without question that on math and read that in fact our minor student our hispan and african american student are do better and that gap between them and the major popul is in fact close
p3684
aVso we are do exact the right thing they re the one who have been for the patriot act and against it for no child left behind and then against it
p3685
aVedward are you sure yes he start yes 30 second pleas yes
p3686
aVwe are for account and we are for high standard john and i vote for no child left behind becaus we thought that account and standard were the right thing to do
p3687
aVbut they make did you figur out you were wrong
p3688
aVedward well in fair if you feel like you need to go to him we ll i ll stop ifil well i do becaus we re actual on the final question i apolog for give you an extra 15 second there i go now to vice presid cheney
p3689
aVwhichev one of you is elect in novemb you mention those three elector vote in wyom and how critic they ve turn out to be
p3690
aVbut what they re a sign of also is that you re go to inherit a veri deepli divid elector econom polit you name it
p3691
aVhow will you set out mr vice presid in a way that you weren t abl to in these past four year to bridg that divid
p3692
aVcheney well i must say it s one of the disappoint of the last four year is that we ve not been abl to do what the presid did in texa for exampl when he was abl to reach across the aisl and bring democrat along on major issu of the day
p3693
aVwe had some success earli on i think in no child left behind when we in fact had broad bipartisan support
p3694
aVwe had a lot of support for the patriot act when we pass that on a bipartisan basi now we re see object to that by the other side all i know is to continu to tri to work it
p3695
aVit s a disappoint in a sens that i rememb from my earlier servic when thing work much differ when in fact some of my best friend in the congress were peopl i work with like tom foley who was a major leader and later speaker of the hous one of my strongest alli in congress when i secretari of defens was jack murtha a democrat who is chairman of the defens appropri subcommitte
p3696
aVwe use to be abl to do more togeth on a bipartisan basi than seem possibl these day i m not sure exact whi i think in part it may be the chang in the major minor status in the senat has been difficult for both side to adjust to
p3697
aVand the senat of cours has been veri even divid 50 50 then 51 49 then 49 51 the other way
p3698
aVwe ll keep work at it
p3699
aVi think it s import for us to tri i believ that it is essenti for us to do everyth we can to garner as much support from the other side of the aisl as possibl we ve had support we had our keynot address at our convent was deliv by zell miller so there are some democrat who agre with our approach
p3700
aVand hope in a second term we ll see an improv along those line
p3701
aVedward thank you
p3702
aVthe presid said that he would unit this countri that he was a unit not a divid
p3703
aVhave you ever seen america more divid have you ever seen washington more divid
p3704
aVthe realiti is it is not an accid it s the direct result of the choic they ve made and their effort that have creat divis in america we can do better than that in this countri
p3705
aVnow i want to go back to the whole issu of health care becaus we touch it but i think the american peopl deserv to know what we would do differ
p3706
aVi mean 5 million peopl lose their health care everyon who s watch this know health insur premium are through the roof
p3707
aVwe need to talk about what we will do that they haven t done
p3708
aVfirst we re go to make the same health care that s avail to member of congress avail to all american we re go to cover all kid
p3709
aVnot onli that we re go to bring down cost by pool the catastroph cost so we bring down premium
p3710
aVand we re go to give tax break direct to famili save them up to 1 000 a year and to busi the vice presid talk about that a few minut ago so that they can provid health care to their employe
p3711
aVand we re also go to final do someth about the cost of prescript drug
p3712
aVthey ve block allow prescript drug into this countri from canada we re go to allow it
p3713
aVthey would not allow the govern to use it negoti power to get discount for senior we re go to allow it
p3714
aVwe re also go to stand up to the drug compani and do someth about these drug compani ad on televis which are out of control
p3715
aVcheney well gwen i m sorri it s hard to know where to start
p3716
aVcheney gwen we ve never let up on osama bin laden from day one we ve activ and aggress pursu him we ve captur or kill thousand of al qaida in various place around the world and especi in afghanistan we ll continu to veri aggress pursu him and i m confid eventu we ll get him
p3717
aVthe fact of the matter is the most import and signific chang in health care in the last sever year was the medicar reform bill this year it s the most sweep chang in 40 year
p3718
aVmedicar use to pay for heart bypass surgeri but didn t pay for the prescript drug that might allow you to avoid it
p3719
aVthe fact is that when that came up senat kerri and senat edward vote against it it ll provid prescript drug benefit to 40 million senior citizen it s a veri veri signific piec of legisl
p3720
aVedward they had a choic on allow prescript drug into this countri from canada of be with the american peopl or with the drug compani they were with the drug compani
p3721
aVthey had a choic on negoti discount in the medicar prescript drug bill of be with the american peopl or with the drug compani they were with the drug compani
p3722
aVthey had a choic on the patient bill of right allow peopl to make their own health care decis and not have insur compani make them be with the american peopl be with the big insur compani
p3723
aVthey re with the insur compani
p3724
aVjohn kerri and i will alway fight for the american peopl
p3725
aVthe key to success in afghanistan has been again to go in and go after the terrorist which we ve done and also take down the taliban regim which allow them to function there in effect sponsor if you will of the al qaida organ

aVwe won t be happi until everi american who want to work can find a job
p3745
aVthat elect will put in place a democrat elect govern that will take over next decemb
p3746
aVwe believ that all american ought to have access to avail to medic care and that they ought to have access to the finest school in the world
p3747
aVwe ll do everyth we can to preserv social secur and to make certain that it s there for futur generat
p3748
aVi ve work for four presid and watch two other up close and i know that there s no such thing as a routin day in the oval offic
p3749
aVwe saw on 9 11 that the next presid next decis a presid has to make can affect the live of all of us
p3750
aVnow we find ourselv in the midst of a conflict unlik ani we ve ever known face with the possibl that terrorist could smuggl a dead biolog agent or a nuclear weapon into the middl of one of our own citi
p3751
aVthat threat and the presidenti leadership need to deal with it is place a special respons on all of you who will decid on novemb 2nd who will be our command in chief
p3752
aVthe onli viabl option for win the war on terror is the one the presid has chosen to use the power of the unit state to aggress go after the terrorist wherev we find them and also to hold to account state that sponsor terror
p3753
aVnow that we ve captur or kill thousand of al qaida and taken down the regim of saddam hussein and the taliban it s import that we stand up democrat elect govern as the onli guarante that they ll never again revert to terror or the product of dead weapon
p3754
aVthis is the task of our generat and i know firsthand the strength the presid bring to it
p3755
aVthe overal outcom will depend upon the abil of the american peopl and the strong leadership of the presid to meet all the challeng that we ll face in the day and year ahead
p3756
aVwe ve made enorm progress in afghanistan in exact the right direct in spite of what john edward said two and a half year ago he just got it wrong
p3757
aVi m confid we can do it
p3758
aVthe fact is as we go forward in afghanistan we will pursu osama bin laden and the terrorist as long as necessari we re stand up afghan secur forc so they can take on respons for their own secur we ll keep u s forc there we have about 16 000 there today as long as necessari to assist the afghan in term of deal with their secur situat but they re make signific progress we have presid karzai who is in power they have done wonder write their own constitut for the first time ever school are open young girl are go to school women are go to vote women are even elig to run for offic this is major major progress there will be democraci in afghanistan make no doubt about it freedom is the best antidot to terror
p3759
aVedward someon did get it wrong but it wasn t john kerri and john edward they got it wrong when we had osama bin laden corner they left the job to the afghan warlord they then divert their attent from the veri peopl who attack us who were at the center of the war on terror and so osama bin laden is still at larg now i want to go back to someth the vice presid said just a minut ago becaus these distort are continu
p3760
aVhe said that made mention of this global test what john kerri said and it s just as clear as day to anybodi who was listen he said we will find terrorist where they are and kill them befor they ever do harm to the american peopl first
p3761
aVwe will keep this countri safe he defend this countri as a young man he will defend this countri as presid of the unit state
p3762
aVhe also said veri clear that he will never give ani countri veto power over the secur of the unit state of america
p3763
aVnow i know the vice presid would like to pretend that wasn t said and the presid would too but the realiti is it was said
p3764
aVhere s what s actual happen in afghanistan regardless of this rosi scenario that they paint on afghanistan just like they do with iraq what s actual happen is they re now provid 75 percent of the world s opium
p3765
aVnot onli are they provid 75 percent of the world s opium larg cut part of the countri are under the control of drug lord and warlord big part of the countri are still insecur
p3766
aVand the realiti is the part of afghanistan eastern afghanistan where osama bin laden is is one of the hardest place to control and the most insecur gwen
p3767
aVcheney twenti year ago we had a similar situat in el salvador we had guerrilla insurg control rough a third of the countri 75 000 peopl dead and we held free elect i was there as an observ on behalf of the congress
p3768
aVthe human drive for freedom the determin of these peopl to vote was unbeliev and the terrorist would come in and shoot up poll place as soon as they left the voter would come back and get in line and would not be deni the right to vote
p3769
aVand today el salvador is a whale of a lot better becaus we held free elect
p3770
aVthe power of that concept is enorm and it will appli in afghanistan and it will appli as well in iraq
p3771
aVedward the vice presid just said that we should focus on state sponsor of terror iran has move forward with it nuclear weapon program they re more danger today than they were four year ago
p3772
aVnorth korea has move forward with their nuclear weapon program gone from one to two nuclear weapon to six to eight nuclear weapon this vice presid has been an advoc for over a decad for lift sanction against iran the largest state sponsor of terror on the planet
p3773
aVit s a mistak we should not onli not lift them we should strengthen those sanction
p3774
aVedward sure
p3775
aVedward well let me say first he said in the same segment i don t rememb precis where it was connect with what you just read but he said point blank we will never give anyon a veto over the secur of the unit state of america
p3776
aVwhat he s say is we re go to go back to the proud tradit of the unit state of america and presid of the unit state of america for the last 50 to 75 year
p3777
aVfirst we re go to actual tell the american peopl the truth we re go to tell them the truth about what s happen
p3778
aVwe re not go to suggest to them that thing are go well in iraq or anyplac els when in fact they re not
p3779
aVwe re go to make sure that the american peopl know the truth about whi we are use forc and what the explan for it is
p3780
aVand it s not just the american peopl we re also go to make sure that we tell the world the truth
p3781
aVbecaus the realiti is for america to lead for america to do what it s done for 50 year befor this presid and vice presid came into offic it is critic that we be credibl
p3782
aVit is critic that they believ that when america take action they can trust what we re do what we say what we say at the unit nation what we say in direct convers with leader of the world of other countri
p3783
aVthey need to know that the credibl of the unit state is alway good becaus they will not follow us without that
p3784
aVand unfortun we re see the consequ of that right now
p3785
aVit s one of the reason that we re have so much difficulti get other involv in the effort in iraq
p3786
aVyou know we ve taken 90 percent of the coalit causal american taxpay have born 90 percent of the cost of the effort in iraq
p3787
aVand we see the result of there not be a coalit the first gulf war cost america 5 billion we re at 200 billion and count
p3788
aVjohn kerri will never give up control over the secur of the unit state of america to ani other countri we will not outsourc our respons to keep this countri safe
p3789
aVnow we also have peopl sicker becaus they don t have health insur so whether it s diabet or cancer they come to the hospit later and it cost america more we ve got to have health care for all american
p3790
aVi think it s import sinc he talk about the medicar plan he s been in the unit state senat for 20 year he has no record on reform of health care no record at all he introduc some 300 bill and he s pass 5 no record of leadership
p3791
aVi came to washington to solv problem i was deepli concern about senior have to choos between prescript drug and food and so i led and in 2006 our senior will get a prescript drug coverag in medicar
p3792
aVonc again the presid is mislead america i ve actual pass 56 individu bill that i ve person written and in addit to that they re not alway under my name there is amend on certain bill
p3793
aVbut more import with respect to the question of no record i help write i did write i was one of the origin author of the earli childhood health care and the expans of health care that we did in the middl of the 1990s and i m veri proud of that so the presid s wrong
p3794
aVthat s correct
p3795
aVbob thank you veri much i want to thank arizona state as well
p3796
aVwell two lead nation news network have both said the presid s character of my health care plan is incorrect one call it fiction the other call it untru the fact is that my health care plan america is veri simpl it give you the choic i don t forc you to do anyth it s not a govern plan the govern doesn t requir you to do anyth you choos your doctor you choos your plan if you don t want to take the offer of the plan that i want to put forward you don t have to you can keep what you have today keep a high deduct keep high premium keep a high co pay keep low benefit but i got a better plan and i don t think a lot of peopl are go to want to keep what they have today
p3797
aVhere s what i do we take over medicaid children from the state so that everi child in america is cover and in exchang if the state want to they re not forc to they can choos to they cover individu up to 300 percent of poverti it s their choic i think they ll choos it becaus it s a net plus of 5 billion to them
p3798
aVwe allow you if you choos to you don t have to but we give you broader competit to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senat and congressmen give themselv if it s good enough for us it s good enough for everi american i believ that your health care is just as import as ani politician in washington dc if you want to buy into it you can we give you broader competit that help lower price
p3799
aVin addit to that we re go to allow peopl 55 to 64 to buy into medicar earli and most import we give small busi a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the cost of health care they also get whether they re self employ or a small busi a lower cost to be abl to cover their employe
p3800
aVnow what happen is when you begin to get peopl cover like that for instanc in diabet if you diagnos diabet earli you could save 50 billion in the health care system of america by avoid surgeri and dialysi it work and i m go to offer it to america
p3801
aVin all due respect i m not so sure it s credibl to quot lead news organ about well never mind anyway
p3802
aVif you rais the medicaid to 300 percent it provid an incent for small busi not to provid privat insur to their employe whi should they insur somebodi when the govern is go to insur for them it s estim that 8 million peopl will go from privat insur to govern insur
p3803
aVwe have a fundament differ of opinion i think govern run health will lead to poor qualiti health will lead to ration will lead to less choic onc a health care program end up in a line item in the feder govern budget it lead to more control and just look at other countri that have tri to have feder control health care they have poor qualiti health care our health care system is the envi of the world becaus we believ in make sure that the decis are made by doctor and patient not by offici in the nation s capit
p3804
aVyes we can be safe and secur if we stay on the offens against the terrorist and if we spread freedom and liberti around the world i have got a comprehens strategi to not onli chase down al qaida wherev it exist and we re make progress three quarter of al qaida leader have been brought to justic but to make sure that countri who harbor terrorist are held to account as a result of secur ourselv and rid the taliban out of afghanistan the afghan peopl had elect this weekend and the first voter was a 19 year old woman think about that freedom is on the march we held to account a terrorist regim in saddam hussein
p3805
aVthe presid just said that govern run health care result in poor qualiti now mayb that explain whi he hasn t fulli fund the va and the va hospit is have troubl and veteran are complain mayb that explain whi medicar patient are complain about be push off of medicar he doesn t adequ fund it
p3806
aVbut let me just say to america i am not propos a govern run program that s not what i have i have blue cross blue shield senat and congressmen have a wide choic american ought to have it too
p3807
aVyou talk about the va we ve increas va fund by 22 billion in the 4 year sinc i ve been presid that s twice the amount that my predecessor increas va fund of cours we re meet our oblig to our veteran and the veteran know that we re expand veteran health care throughout the countri we re align facil where the veteran live now veteran are get veri good health care under my administr and they will continu to do so dure the next 4 year
p3808
aVbob first let me make sure that everi senior listen today understand that when we re talk about reform social secur that they ll still get their check i rememb the 2000 campaign peopl said if georg w get elect your check will be taken away well peopl got their check and they will continu to get their check
p3809
aVthere is a problem for our youngster a real problem and if we don t act today the problem will be valu in the trillion and so i think we need to think differ we ll honor our commit to our senior but for young for our children and our grandchildren we need to have a differ strategi in recogn that i call togeth a group of our fellow citizen to studi the issu it was a committe chair by the late senat daniel patrick moynihan of new york a democrat and they came up with a varieti of idea for peopl to look at
p3810
aVi believ that younger worker ought to be allow to take some of their own money and put it in a person save account becaus i understand that they need to get better rate of return than the rate of return be given in the current social secur trust and the compound rate of interest effect will make it more like that the social secur system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren
p3811
aVin other word in order to make sure we re secur there must be a comprehens plan my oppon just this weekend talk about how terror could be reduc to a nuisanc compar it to prostitut and illeg gambl i think that attitud and that point of view is danger i don t think you can secur america for the long run if you don t have a comprehens view as to how to defeat these peopl
p3812
aVi will work with republican and democrat this will be a vital issu in my second term it is an issu that i m will to take on and so i ll bring republican and democrat togeth and we re of cours go to have to consid the cost but i want to warn my fellow citizen the cost of do noth the cost of say the current system is okay far exceed the cost of tri to make sure we save the system for our children
p3813
aVyou just heard the presid say that young peopl ought to be abl to take money out of social secur and put it in their own account now my fellow american that s an invit to disast the cbo said veri clear that if you were to adopt the presid s plan there will be a 2 trillion hole in social secur becaus today s worker pay into the system for today s retire and the cbo said that s the congression budget offic it s bipartisan they said that there would have to be a cut in benefit of 25 to 40 percent
p3814
aVnow the presid has never explain to america ever hasn t done it tonight where doe the transit money that 2 trillion come from he s alreadi got 3 trillion accord to the washington post of expens that he s put on the line from his convent and the promis of this campaign none of which are paid for not one of them are paid for
p3815
aVthe fact is that the presid is drive the largest deficit in american histori he s broken the pay as you go rule i have a record of fight for fiscal respons in 1985 i was one of the first democrat broke with my parti we balanc the budget in the nineti we paid down the debt for 2 year and that s what we re go to do we re go to protect social secur i will not privat it i will not cut the benefit and we re go to be fiscal respons and we will take care of social secur
p3816
aVnot at all absolut not bob this is the same thing we heard i rememb i appear on meet the press with tim russert in 1990 someth we heard the same thing we fix it in fact we put togeth a 5 6 trillion surplus in the nineti that was for the purpos of save social secur if you take the tax cut that the presid of the unit state has given presid bush gave to american in the top 1 percent of america just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of america would have save social secur until the year 2075 the presid decid to give it to the wealthiest american in a tax cut
p3817
aVnow alan greenspan who i think has done a terrif job in monetari polici support the presid s tax cut i don t i support it for the middl class not that part of it that goe to peopl earn more than 200 000 a year and when i roll it back and we invest in the thing that i ve talk about to move our economi we re go to grow suffici that we begin to cut the deficit in half and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanc the budget and paid down the debt of this countri now we can do that
p3818
aVnow if later on after a period of time we find that social secur is in troubl then we ll pull togeth the top expert of the countri we ll do exact what we did in the 1990s and we ll make whatev adjust is necessari but the first and most import thing is to start creat job in america the job the presid is creat pay 9 000 less than the job that we re lose and this is the first presid in 72 year to presid over an economi in america that has lost job 1 6 million job eleven other presid six democrat and five republican had war had recess had great difficulti none of them lost job the way this presid has
p3819
aVi have a plan to put america back to work and if we re fiscal respons and put america back to work we re go to fix social secur
p3820
aVat home we ll do everyth we can to protect the homeland i sign the homeland secur bill to better align our asset and resourc my oppon vote against it we re do everyth we can to protect our border and port but absolut we can be secur in the long run it just take good strong leadership
p3821
aVhe forgot to tell you he vote to tax social secur benefit more than one time i didn t hear ani plan to fix social secur i heard more of the same he talk about middl class tax cut that s exact where the tax cut went most of the tax cut went to low and middl incom american and now the tax code is more fair 20 percent of the upper incom peopl pay about 80 percent of the tax in america today becaus of how we structur the tax cut peopl listen out there know the benefit of the tax cut we pass if you have a child you got tax relief if you re marri you got tax relief if you pay ani tax at all you got tax relief all of which was oppos by my oppon and the tax relief was import to spur consumpt and invest to get us out of this recess
p3822
aVpeopl need to rememb 6 month prior to my arriv the stock market start to go down and it was one of the largest declin in our histori and then we had a recess and we got attack which cost us one million job but we act i led the congress we pass tax relief and now this economi is grow we ad 1 9 million new job over the last 13 month
p3823
aVsure there s more work to do but the way to make sure our economi grow is not to rais tax on small busi owner it s not to increas the scope of the feder govern it s to make sure we have fiscal saniti and keep tax low
p3824
aVi see it as a serious problem i see it as a secur issu i see it as an econom issu and i see it as a human right issu we re increas the border secur of the unit state we ve got 1 000 more border patrol agent on the southern border we re use new equip we re use unman vehicl to spot peopl come across and we ll continu to do so over the next 4 year this is a subject i m veri familiar with after all i was a border governor for a while
p3825
aVmani peopl are come to this countri for econom reason they re come here to work if you can make 50 cent in the heart of mexico for exampl or make 5 here in america 5 15 you re go to come here if you re worth your salt if you want to put food on the tabl for your famili and that s what s happen
p3826
aVand so in order to take pressur off the border in order to make the border more secur i believ there ought to be a temporari worker card that allow a will worker and a will employ to mate up so long as there s not an american will to do the job to join up in order to be abl to fulfil the employ s need that has the benefit of make sure our employ aren t break the law as they tri to fill their workforc need it make sure that the peopl come across the border are human treat that they re not kept in the shadow of our societi that they re abl to go back and forth to see their famili see the card will have a period of time attach to it
p3827
aVit also mean it take pressur off the border if somebodi is come here to work with a card it mean they re not go to have to sneak across the border it mean our border patrol will be more like to be abl to focus on do their job
p3828
aVnow it s veri import for our citizen to also know that i don t believ we ought to have amnesti i don t think we ought to reward illeg behavior there are plenti of peopl stand in line to becom a citizen and we ought not to crowd these peopl ahead of them in line if they want to becom a citizen they can stand in line too and here s where my oppon and i differ in septemb 2003 he support amnesti for illeg alien
p3829
aVlet me just answer one part of that last question quick and then i ll come to immigr the american middl class famili isn t make it right now bob and what the presid said about the tax cut have been wipe out by the increas in health care the increas in gasolin the increas in tuition the increas in prescript drug the fact is the take home pay of a typic american famili as a share of nation incom is lower than it s been sinc 1929 and the take home pay of the richest 1 percent of american is the highest it s been sinc 1928 under presid bush the middl class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest tax burden has gone down now that s wrong
p3830
aVnow with respect to immigr reform the presid broke his promis on immigr reform he said he would reform it four year later he s now promis anoth plan here s what i ll do number one the border are more leak today than they were befor 9 11 the fact is we haven t done what we need to do to toughen up our border and i will
p3831
aVsecond we need a guest worker program but if it s all we have it s not go to solv the problem the second thing we need is to crack down on illeg hire it s against the law in the unit state to hire peopl illeg and we ought to be enforc that law proper
p3832
aVand third we need an earn legal program for peopl who ve been here for a long time stay out of troubl got a job paid their tax and their kid are american we ve got to start move them toward full citizenship out of the shadow
p3833
aVwell to say that the border are not as protect as they were prior to septemb the 11th show he doesn t know the border they re much better protect today than they were when i was the governor of texa we ve got much more manpow much more equip there he just doesn t understand how the border work evid to say that that is an outrag claim and we ll continu to protect our border we ll continu to increas manpow and equip
p3834
aVyes when the presid had an opportun to captur or kill usama bin laden he took his focus off of him outsourc the job to afghan warlord and usama bin laden escap six month after he said usama bin laden must be caught dead or aliv this presid was ask where is usama bin laden he said i don t know i don t realli think about him veri much i m not that concern we need a presid who stay dead focus on the real war on terror
p3835
aVfour thousand peopl a day are come across the border the fact is that we now have peopl from the middl east alleg come across the border and we re not do what we ought to do in term of the technolog we have iri identif technolog we have thumbprint fingerprint technolog today we can know who the peopl are that they re realli the peopl they say they are when they cross the border we could speed it up there are huge delay the fact is our border are not as secur as they ought to be and i ll make them secur
p3836
aVwell i m glad you rais that question it s long overdu time to rais the minimum wage and america this is one of those issu that separ the presid and myself we have fought to tri to rais the minimum wage in the last year but the republican leadership of the hous and senat won t even let us have a vote on it we re not allow to vote on it they don t want to rais the minimum wage
p3837
aVthe minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage valu it has been in our nation in 50 year if we rais the minimum wage which i will do over sever year to 7 an hour 9 2 million women who are tri to rais their famili would earn anoth 3 800 a year the presid has deni 9 2 million women 3 800 a year but he doesn t hesit to fight for 136 000 to a millionair one percent of america got 89 billion last year in a tax cut but peopl work hard play by the rule tri to take care of their kid famili valu that we re suppos to valu so much in america i m tire of politician who talk about famili valu and don t valu famili what we need to do is rais the minimum wage
p3838
aVwe also need to hold onto equal pay women work for 76 cent on the dollar for the same work that men do that s not right in america and we have an initi that we were work on to rais women s pay they ve cut it off they ve stop it they don t enforc these kind of thing i think that it is a matter of fundament right that if we rais the minimum wage 15 million american would be posit affect we d put money into the hand of peopl who work hard who obey the rule who play for the american dream and if we did that we d have more consumpt abil in america which is what we need right now in order to kick our economi into gear i will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage
p3839
aVactual mitch mcconnel had a minimum wage plan that i support that would have increas the minimum wage
p3840
aVbut let me talk about what s realli import for the worker you re refer to and that s to make sure the educ system work is to make sure we rais standard listen the no child left behind act is realli a job act when you think about it the no child left behind act say we ll rais standard we ll increas feder spend but in return for extra spend we now want peopl to measur state and local jurisdict to measur to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract you cannot solv a problem unless you diagnos the problem and we weren t diagnos problem and therefor just kid were be shuffl through the school and guess who would get shuffl through children whose parent wouldn t speak english as first languag just move through mani inner citi kid just move through we ve stop that practic now by measur earli and when we find a problem we spend extra money to correct it
p3841
aVi rememb a ladi in houston texa tell me read is the new civil right and she s right in order to make sure peopl have job for the 21st centuri we ve got to get it right in the educ system and we re begin to close a minor achiev gap now you see we d never be abl to compet in the 21st centuri unless we have an educ system that doesn t quit on children an educ system that rais standard an educ that make sure there s excel in everi classroom
p3842
aVwhat he s ask me is will i have a litmus test for my judg and the answer is no i will not have a litmus test i will pick judg who will interpret the constitut but i ll have no litmus test
p3843
aVis that a new question or a 30 second question
p3844
aVwhich time limit are we
p3845
aVthank you veri much well again the presid didn t answer the question i will answer it straight to america i m not go to appoint a judg to the court who is go to undo a constitut right whether it s the first amend or the fifth amend or some other right that s given under our court today under the constitut and i believ that the right of choic is a constitut right so i don t intend to see it undon clear the presid want to leav an ambival or intend to undo it
p3846
aVlet me go a step further we have a long distanc yet to travel in term of fair in america i don t know how you can govern in this countri when you look at new york citi and you see that 50 percent of the black male there are unemploy when you see 40 percent of hispan children of black children in some citi drop out of high school and yet the presid who talk about no child left behind refus to fulli fund by 28 billion that particular program so you can make a differ in the live of those young peopl
p3847
aVgosh i don t think i ever said i m not worri about usama bin laden that s kind of one of those exagger of cours we re worri about usama bin laden we re on the hunt after usama bin laden we re use everi asset at our dispos to get usama bin laden
p3848
aVnow right here in arizona that differ would have been 131 million to the state of arizona to help it kid be abl to have better educ and to lift the properti tax burden from it citizen the presid reneg on his promis to fund no child left behind he will tell you he s rais the money and he has but he didn t put in what he promis and that make a differ in the live of our children
p3849
aVtwo thing one he clear has a litmus test for his judg which i disagre with
p3850
aVand second onli a liber senat from massachusett would say that a 49 percent increas in fund for educ was not enough we ve increas fund but more import we ve reform the system to make sure that we solv problem earli befor they re too late he talk about the unemploy absolut we ve got to make sure they get educ he talk about children whose parent don t speak english as a first languag absolut we ve got to make sure they get educ and that s what the no child left behind act doe
p3851
aVyou don t measur it by a percentag increas mr presid you measur it by whether you re get the job done five hundr thousand kid lost after school program becaus of your budget now that s not in my gut that s not my valu system and certain not so that the wealthiest peopl in america can walk away with anoth tax cut 89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of american but kid lost their after school program you be the judg
p3852
aVwell i think the fact that they re face these repeat callup some of them two and three deploy and there s a stop loss polici that prevent peopl from be abl to get out when their time was up is a reflect of the bad judgment this presid exercis in how he has engag in the world and deploy our forc our militari is overextend nine out of ten activ duti armi divis are either in iraq go to iraq or have come back from iraq one way or the other they re wrap up in it
p3853
aVnow i ve propos ad two activ duti divis to the arm forc of the unit state one combat one support in addit i m go to doubl the number of special forc so that we can fight a more effect war on terror with less pressur on the nation guard and reserv and what i would like to do is see the nation guard and reserv be deploy differ here in our own countri there s much we can do with them with respect to homeland secur we ought to be do that and that would reliev an enorm amount of pressur
p3854
aVmy oppon said this war is a matter of intellig and law enforc no this is a war is a matter of use everi asset at our dispos to keep the american peopl protect
p3855
aVbut the most import thing to reliev the pressur on all of our arm forc is frank to run a foreign polici that recogn that america is strongest when we are work with real allianc when we are share the burden of the world by work through our statesmanship at the highest level and our diplomaci to bring other nation to our side
p3856
aVi ve said it befor i say it again i believ the presid broke faith with the american peopl in the way that he took this nation to war he said he would work through the a real allianc he said in cincinnati we would plan care we would take everi precaut well we didn t and the result is our forc today are overextend the fact is that he did not choos to go to war as a last resort and america now is pay alreadi 120 billion up to 200 billion befor we re finish and much more probabl and that is the result of this presid take his eye off of usama bin laden
p3857
aVthe best way to take the pressur off our troop is to succeed in iraq is to train iraqi so they can do the hard work of democraci is to give them a chanc to defend their countri which is precis what we re do we ll have 125 000 troop train by the end of this year
p3858
aVi rememb go on an airplan in bangor main to say thank to the reservist and guard that were head oversea from tennesse and north carolina and georgia some of them had been there befor the peopl i talk to the spirit were high they didn t view their servic as a backdoor draft they view their servic as an opportun to serv their countri
p3859
aVmy oppon the senat talk about foreign polici in our first debat he propos america pass a global test in order to defend ourselv we have to get intern approv that s one of the major differ we have about defend our countri i work with alli i work with friend we ll continu to build strong coalit but i will never turn over our nation secur decis to leader of other countri we ll be resolut we ll be strong and we will wage a comprehens war against the terrorist
p3860
aVi have never suggest a test where we turn over our secur to ani nation in fact i ve said the opposit i will never turn the secur of the unit state over to ani nation no nation will ever have a veto over us but i think it make sens i think most american in their gut know that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard that s how you gain legitimaci with your own countrypeopl and that s how you gain legitimaci in the world but i will never fail to protect the unit state of america
p3861
aVin 1990 there was a vast coalit put togeth to run saddam hussein out of kuwait the intern communiti the intern world said this is the right thing to do but when it came time to author the use of forc on the senat floor my oppon vote against the use of forc appar you can t pass ani test under his vision of the world
p3862
aVactual i made my intent i made my view clear i did think we ought to extend the assault weapon ban and was told the fact that the bill was never go to move becaus republican and democrat were against the assault weapon ban peopl of both parti
p3863
aVnow i believ law abid citizen ought to be abl to own a gun i believ in background check at gun show or anywher to make sure that gun don t get in the hand of peopl that shouldn t have them but the best way to protect our citizen from gun is to prosecut those who commit crime with gun and that s whi earli in my administr i call the attorney general and the u s attorney and said put togeth a task forc all around the countri to prosecut those who commit crime with gun and the prosecut are up by about 68 percent i believ is the number neighborhood are safer when we crack down on peopl who commit crime with gun to me that s the best way to secur america
p3864
aVi believ it was a failur of presidenti leadership not to reauthor the assault weapon ban i am a hunter i m a gun owner i ve been a hunter sinc i was a kid 12 13 year old and i respect the second amend and i will not tamper with the second amend but i ll tell you this i m also a former law enforc offic i ran one of the largest district attorney offic in america one of the 10 largest i ve put peopl behind bar for the rest of their life i ve broken up organ crime i know someth about prosecut and most of the law enforc agenc in america want that assault weapon ban they don t want to go into a drug bust and be face an ak 47
p3865
aVi was hunt in iowa last year with the sheriff from one of the counti there and he point to a hous in back of us and said see that hous over there we just did a drug bust a week earlier and the guy we arrest had an ak 47 lie on the bed right besid him
p3866
aVbecaus of the presid s decis today law enforc offic will walk into a place that will be more danger terrorist can now come into america and go to a gun show and without even a background check buy an assault weapon today and that s what usama bin laden s handbook said becaus we captur it in afghanistan and it encourag them to do it
p3867
aVso i believ america is less safe if tom delay or someon in the hous said to me sorri we don t have the vote i d have said then we re go to have a fight and i d have taken it out to the countri and i d have had everi law enforc offic in the countri visit those congressmen we d have won what bill clinton won
p3868
aVno bob regrett we have not move far enough along and i regret to say that this administr has even block step that could help us move further along i ll give you an exampl
p3869
aVi m the i serv on the small busi committe for a long time i was chairman of it onc now i m the senior democrat on it we use to we have a goal there for minor set asid program to tri to encourag ownership in the countri they don t reach those goal they don t even fight to reach those goal they ve tri to undo them
p3870
aVthe fact is that in too mani part of our countri we still have discrimin and affirm action is not just someth that appli to peopl of color some peopl have a mistaken view of it in america it also is with respect to women it s with respect to other effort to tri to reach out and be inclus in our countri i think that we have a long way to go regrett if you look at what s happen we ve made progress i want to say that at the same time
p3871
aVdure the clinton year as you may recal there was a fight over affirm action and there were mani peopl like myself who oppos quota who felt there were place where it was overreach so we had a polici call mend it don t end it we fix it and we fix it for a reason becaus there are too mani peopl still in this countri who feel the stark resist of racism and so we have a distanc to travel as presid i will make certain we travel it
p3872
aVnow let me just share someth this presid is the first presid ever i think not to meet with the naacp this is a presid who hasn t met with the black congression caucus this is a presid who has not met with the civil right leadership of our countri if a presid doesn t reach out and bring peopl in and be inclus then how are we go to get over those barrier i see that as part of my job as presid and i ll make my best effort to do it
p3873
aVwell first of all it is just not true that i haven t met with the black congression caucus i met with the black congression caucus at the white hous
p3874
aVand second like my oppon i don t agre we ought to have quota i agre we shouldn t have quota but we ought to have an aggress effort to make sure peopl are educ to make sure when they get out of high school there s pell grant avail for them which is what we ve done we ve expand pell grant by a million student do you realiz today in america we spend 73 billion to help 10 million low and middl incom famili better afford colleg that s the access i believ is necessari is to make sure everi child learn to read write add and subtract earli to be abl to build on that educ by go to colleg so they can start their career with a colleg diploma
p3875
aVi believ the best way to help our small busi is not onli through small busi loan which we have increas sinc i ve been the presid of the unit state but to unbundl govern contract so peopl will have a chanc to be abl to bid and receiv a contract to help get their busi go
p3876
aVminor ownership of busi are up becaus we creat an environ for the entrepreneuri spirit to be strong i think i believ part of a hope societi is one in which somebodi own someth today in america more minor own a home than ever befor and that s hope and that s posit
p3877
aVbob we reli upon a compani out of england to provid about half of the flu vaccin for the unit state citizen and it turn out that the vaccin they were produc was contamin and so we took the right action and didn t allow contamin medicin into our countri we re work with canada to hope that they ll produc a help us realiz the vaccin necessari to make sure our citizen have got flu vaccin dure this upcom season
p3878
aVfirst my faith play a lot a big part in my life and that s when i was answer that question what i was realli say to the person was that i pray a lot and i do and my faith is a veri it s veri person i pray for strength i pray for wisdom i pray for our troop in harm s way i pray for my famili i pray for my littl girl but i m mind in a free societi that peopl can worship if they want to or not you re equal an american if you choos to worship an almighti and if you choos not to if you re a christian jew or muslim you re equal an american that s the great thing about america is the right to worship the way you see fit
p3879
aVprayer and religion sustain me i ve receiv calm in the storm of the presid i love the fact that peopl pray for me and my famili all around the countri somebodi ask me one time well how do you know i said i just feel it religion is an import part i never want to impos my religion on anybodi els but when i make decis i stand on principl and the principl are deriv from who i am i believ we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself that s manifest in public polici through the faith base initi where we ve unleash the armi of compass to help seal heal peopl who hurt
p3880
aVi believ that god want everybodi to be free that s what i believ and that s part of my foreign polici in afghanistan i believ that the freedom there is a gift from the almighti and i can t tell you how encourag i am to see freedom on the march and so my principl that i make decis on are a part of me and religion is a part of me
p3881
aVwell i respect everyth that the presid has said and certain i respect his faith i think it s import and i share it i think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the almighti everyth is a gift from the almighti and as i measur the word of the bibl and we all do differ peopl measur differ thing the koran the torah or nativ american who gave me a bless the other day had their own special sens of connected to a higher be and peopl all find their way to express it
p3882
aVi was taught i went to a church school and i was taught that the two greatest command are love the lord your god with all your mind your bodi and your soul and love your neighbor as yourself and frank i think we have a lot more love of our neighbor to do in this countri and on this planet
p3883
aVwe have a separ and unequ school system in the unit state of america there s one for the peopl who have and there s one for the peopl who don t have and we re struggl with that today the presid and i have a differ of opinion about how we live out our sens of our faith i talk about it earlier when i talk about the work and faith without work be dead i think we ve got a lot more work to do and as presid i will alway respect everybodi s right to practic religion as they choos or not to practic becaus that s part of america
p3884
aVmy call to our fellow american is if you re healthi if you re younger don t get a flu shot this year help us priorit those who need to get the flu shot the elder and the young the cdc respons for health in the unit state is set those prioriti and is alloc the flu vaccin accord i haven t gotten a flu shot and i don t intend to becaus i want to make sure that those who are most vulner get treat
p3885
aVwell veri much so let me pay a compliment to the presid if i may i think in those day after 9 11 i thought the presid did a terrif job and i realli was move as well as impress by the speech that he gave to the congress and i think the hug tom daschl gave him at that moment was about as genuin a sens of there be no democrat no republican we were all just american that s where we were
p3886
aVthat s not where we are today i regret to say that the presid who call himself a unit not a divid is now presid over the most divid america in the recent memori of our countri i ve never seen such ideolog squabbl in the congress of the unit state i ve never seen member of a parti lock out of meet the way they re lock out today
p3887
aVwe have to chang that and as presid i am commit to chang that i don t care if the idea come from the other side or this side i think we have to come togeth and work to chang it and i ve done that over 20 year in the unit state senat i ve work with john mccain who s sit here i ve work with other colleagu i ve reach across the aisl i ve tri to find the common ground becaus that s what make us strong as american
p3888
aVand if american trust me with the presid i can pledg to you we will have the most signific effort open not secret meet in the white hous with special interest not ideolog driven effort to push peopl asid but a genuin effort to tri to restor america s hope and possibl by bring peopl togeth
p3889
aVand one of the way we re go to do it is i m go to work with my friend john mccain to further campaign financ reform so we get these incred amount of money out of the system and open it up to averag peopl so america is realli repres by the peopl who make up america
p3890
aVmy biggest disappoint in washington is how partisan the town is i had a record of work with republican and democrat as the governor of texa and i was hope to be abl to do the same thing and we made good progress earli on the no child left behind act incred enough was good work between me and my administr and peopl like senat ted kennedi and we work togeth with democrat to reliev the tax burden on the middl class and all who pay tax in order to make sure this economi continu to grow
p3891
aVbut washington is a tough town and the way i view it is there s a lot of entrench special interest there peopl who are on one side of the issu or anoth and they spend enorm sum of money and they convinc differ senat to tout their way or differ congressmen to talk about their issu and they dig in
p3892
aVi ll continu in the 4 year to continu to tri to work to do so my oppon said this is a bitter divid time it was pretti divid in the 2000 elect so in other word it s pretti divid dure the 1990s as well we re just in a period and we ve got to work to bring it out
p3893
aVwe have a problem with litig in the unit state of america vaccin manufactur are worri about get su and so therefor they have back off from provid this kind of vaccin one of the reason i m such a strong believ in legal reform is so that peopl aren t afraid of produc a product that is necessari for the health of our citizen and then end up get su in a court of law
p3894
aVmy oppon keep mention john mccain and i m glad he did john mccain is for me for presid becaus he understand i have the right view in win the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in iraq and my oppon has got a plan of retreat and defeat in iraq
p3895
aVto listen to them
p3896
aVbut they see a compassion strong great first ladi in laura bush i can t tell you how lucki i am when i met her in the backyard at joe and jan o neill in midland texa it was the classic backyard barbecu o neill said come on over i think you ll find somebodi who might interest you so i said all right pop over there there was onli four of us there and not onli did she interest me i guess you could say it was love at first sight
p3897
aVwell i guess the presid and you and i are three exampl of lucki peopl who marri up
p3898
aVcan i say if i could just say a word about a woman that you didn t ask about but my mom pass away a coupl year ago just befor i was decid to run and she was in the hospit and i went in to talk to her and tell her what i was think of do and she look at me from her hospit bed and she just look at me and she said rememb integr integr integr those are the three word that she left me with
p3899
aVbut the best thing we can do now bob given the circumst with the compani in england is for those of us who are younger and healthi don t get a flu shot
p3900
aVmy fellow american as you heard from bob schieffer a moment ago america is be test by divis more than ever we need to be unit as a countri and like franklin roosevelt i don t care whether an idea is a republican idea or a democrat idea i just care whether it work for america and whether it s go to make us stronger
p3901
aVthese are danger time i believ i offer test strong leadership that can calm the water of a troubl world and i believ that we can togeth do thing that are within the grasp of american we can lift our school up we can creat job that pay more than the job we re lose oversea we can have health care for all american we can further the caus of equal in our nation
p3902
aVlet me just make it clear i will never allow ani countri to have a veto over our secur just as i fought for our countri as a young man with the same passion i will fight to defend this nation that i love and with faith in god and with convict in the mission of america i believ that we can reach higher i believ we can do better i think the greatest possibl of our countri our dream and our hope are out there just wait for us to grab onto them
p3903
aVand i ask you to embark on that journey with me i ask you for your trust i ask you for your help i ask you to allow me the privileg of lead this great nation of our of help us to be stronger here at home and to be respect again in the world and most of all to be safer forev
p3904
aVthank you good night and god bless the unit state of america
p3905
aVin the oval offic there s a paint by a friend of laura and mine name by tom lea it s a west texa paint a paint of a mountain scene and he said this about it he said sarah and i live on the east side of the mountain it s the sunris side not the sunset side it s the side to see the day that is come not to see the day that is gone i love the optim in that paint becaus that s how i feel about america
p3906
aVyou know we ve been through a lot togeth dure the last 3 3 4 year we ve come through a recess a stock market declin an attack on our countri and yet becaus of the hard work of the american peopl and good polici this economi is grow over the next 4 year we ll make sure the economi continu to grow
p3907
aVwe reform our school system and now there s an achiev gap in america that is begin to close over the next 4 year we ll continu to insist on excel in everi classroom in america so that our children have a chanc to realiz the great promis of america
p3908
aVover the next 4 year we ll continu to work to make sure health care is avail and afford over the next 4 year we ll continu to ralli the armi of compass to help heal the hurt that exist in some of our countri s neighborhood
p3909
aVi m optimist that we ll win the war on terror but i understand it requir firm resolv and clear purpos we must never waver in the face of this enemi that these ideologu of hate and as we pursu the enemi wherev it exist we ll also spread freedom and liberti we ve got great faith in the abil of liberti to transform societi to convert hostil a hostil world to a peac world my hope for america is a prosper america a hope america and a safer world
p3910
aVi want to thank you for listen tonight i m ask for your vote god bless you
p3911
aVthis realli underscor the problem with the american health care system it s not work for the american famili and it s gotten wors under presid bush over the cours of the last year five million american have lost their health insur in this countri you got about a million right here in arizona just shi 950 000 who have no health insur at all eighti two thousand arizonian lost their health insur under presid bush s watch two hundr and twenti three thousand kid in arizona have no health insur at all all across our countri go to ohio 1 4 million ohioan have no health insur 114 000 of them lost it under presid bush wisconsin 82 000 wisconsinit lost it under presid bush
p3912
aVthis presid has turn his back on the well of america and there is no system in fact it s start to fall apart not becaus of lawsuit though they are a problem and john edward and i are commit to fix them but becaus of the larger issu that we don t cover american children across our countri don t have health care we re the richest countri on the face of the planet the onli industri nation in the world not to do it i have a plan to cover all american we re go to make it afford and access we re go to let everybodi buy into the same health care plan the senat and congressmen give themselv
p3913
aVi would thank you i want to remind peopl listen tonight that a plan is not a litani of complaint and a plan is not to lay out program that you can t pay for he just said he want everybodi to be abl to buy into the same plan that senat and congressman get that cost the govern 7 700 per famili if everi famili in america sign up like the senat suggest it would cost us 5 trillion over 10 year it s an empti promis it s call bait and switch
p3914
aVthank you
p3915
aVactual it s not an empti promis it s realli interest becaus the presid use that veri plan as a reason for senior to accept his prescript drug plan he said if it s good enough for the congressmen and senat to have choic senior ought to have choic
p3916
aVwhat we do is we have choic i choos blue cross blue shield other senat other congressman choos other program but the fact is we re go to help american be abl to buy into it those that can afford it are go to buy in themselv we re not give this away for noth
p3917
aVi ll tell you exact how i can do it by reinstat what presid bush took away which is call pay as you go dure the 1990s we had pay as you go rule if you were go to pass someth in the congress you had to show where you were go to pay for it and how
p3918
aVpresid bush has taken he s the onli presid in histori to do this he s also the onli presid sinc in 72 year to lose job 1 6 million job lost he s the onli presid to have incom of famili go down for the last 3 year the onli presid to see export go down the onli presid to see the lowest level of busi invest in our countri as it is today
p3919
aVnow i m go to revers that i m go to chang that we re go to restor the fiscal disciplin we had in the 1990s everi plan that i have laid out my health care plan my plan for educ my plan for kid to be abl to get better colleg loan i ve shown exact how i m go to pay for those and we start we don t do it exclus but we start by roll back georg bush s unafford tax cut for the wealthiest peopl peopl earn more than 200 000 a year and we pass hope the mccain kerri commiss which identifi some 60 billion that we can get we shut the loophol which has american worker actual subsid the loss of their own job they just pass an expans of that loophol in the last few day 43 billion of giveaway includ favor to the oil and gas industri and to peopl import ceil fan from china
p3920
aVi m go to stand up and fight for the american worker and i m go to do it in a way that s fiscal sound i show how i pay for the health care how we pay for the educ i have a manufactur job credit we pay for it by shut that loophol oversea we rais the student loan i pay for it by chang the relationship with the bank this presid has never onc veto one bill the first presid in 100 year not to do that
p3921
aVwell his rhetor doesn t match his record he s been a senat for 20 year he vote to increas tax 98 time when they tri to reduc tax he vote against that 127 time he talk about be a fiscal conserv or fiscal sound but he vote over he vote 277 time to waiv the budget cap which would have cost the taxpay 4 2 trillion he talk about pay go i ll tell you what pay go mean when you re a senat from massachusett when you re a colleagu of ted kennedi pay go mean you pay and he goe ahead and spend
p3922
aVhe s propos 2 2 trillion of new spend and yet the so call tax on the rich which is also a tax on mani small busi owner in america rais 600 million by our account billion 800 billion by his account there is a tax gap and guess who usual end up fill the tax gap the middl class
p3923
aVi propos a detail budget bob i sent up my budget man to the congress and he say here s how we re go to reduc the deficit in half by 5 year it requir pro growth polici that grow our economi and fiscal saniti in the hall of congress
p3924
aVi say bob i ve got polici to continu to grow our economi and creat the job of the 21st centuri and here s some help for you to go get an educ here s some help for you to go to a communiti colleg we ve expand trade adjust assist we want to help pay for you to gain the skill necessari to fill the job of the 21st centuri
p3925
aVyou know there s a lot of talk about how to keep the economi grow and we talk about fiscal matter but perhap the best way to keep job here in america and to keep this economi grow is to make sure our educ system work
p3926
aVi went to washington to solv problem and i saw a problem in the public educ system in america they were just shuffl too mani kid through the system year after year grade after grade without learn the basic and so we said let s rais the standard we re spend more money but let s rais the standard and measur earli and solv problem now befor it s too late
p3927
aVyou know educ is how to help the person who has lost a job educ is how to make sure this we ve got a workforc that s product and competit you got 4 more year i ve got more to do to continu to rais standard to continu to reward teacher and school district that are work to emphas math and scienc in the classroom to continu to expand pell grant to make sure that peopl have an opportun to start their career with a colleg diploma
p3928
aVand so to the person you talk to i say here s some help here s some trade adjust assist money for you to go to a communiti colleg in your neighborhood a communiti colleg which is provid the skill necessari to fill the job of the 21st centuri and that s what we d say to that person
p3929
aVi want you to notic how the presid switch away from job and start talk about educ princip let me come back in one moment to that but i want to speak for a second if i can to what the presid said about fiscal respons be lectur by the presid on fiscal respons is a littl bit like toni soprano talk to me about law and order in this countri
p3930
aVthis presid has taken a 5 6 trillion surplus and turn it into deficit as far as the eye can see health care cost for the averag american have gone up 64 percent tuition have gone up 35 percent gasolin price up 30 percent medicar premium went up 17 percent a few day ago prescript drug are up 12 percent a year but guess what america the wage of american have gone down the job that are be creat in arizona right now are pay about 13 700 less than the job that we re lose and the presid just walk on by this problem
p3931
aVthe fact is that he s cut job train money a billion dollar was cut they onli ad a littl bit back this year becaus it s an elect year they ve cut the pell grant and the perkin loan to help kid be abl to go to colleg they ve cut the train money they ve wound up not even extend unemploy benefit and not even extend health care to those peopl who are unemploy i m go to do those thing becaus that s what right in america help worker to transit in everi respect
p3932
aVi don t blame them entir for it i blame the presid for the thing the presid could do that has an impact on it outsourc is go to happen i ve acknowledg that in union hall across the countri i ve had shop steward stand up and say will you promis me you re go to stop all this outsourc and i ve look them in the eye and i ve said no i can t do that
p3933
aVwhat i can promis you is that i will make the play field as fair as possibl that i will for instanc make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in america are not subsid the loss of your job today if you re an american busi you actual get a benefit for go oversea you get to defer your tax so if you re look at a competit world you say to yourself hey i do better oversea than i do here in america that s not smart i don t want american worker subsid the loss of their own job and when i m presid we re go to shut that loophol in a nanosecond and we re go to use that money to lower corpor tax rate in america for all corpor 5 percent and we re go to have a manufactur job credit and a job hire credit so we actual help peopl be abl to hire here
p3934
aVwell first of all bob thank you for moder tonight thank you arizona state for welcom us and thank you to the presidenti commiss for undertak this enorm task we re proud to be here mr presid i m glad to be here with you again to share similar and differ with the american peopl
p3935
aVthe second thing that we can do is provid a fair trade play field this presid didn t stand up for boe when airbus was violat intern rule with subsidi he discov boe dure the cours of this campaign after i ve been talk about it for month the fact is that the presid had an opportun to stand up and take on china for currenc manipul there are compani that want to petit the administr they were told don t even bother we re not go to listen to it
p3936
aVthe fact is that there have been market shut to us that we haven t stood up and fought for i m go to fight for a fair trade play field for the american worker and i will fight for the american worker just as hard as i fight for my own job that s what the american worker want and if we do that we can have an impact plus we need fiscal disciplin restor fiscal disciplin we ll do a lot better
p3937
aVwhoo let me start with the pell grant in his last litani of misstat he said we cut pell grant we ve increas pell grant by a million student that s a fact
p3938
aVhere he talk to the worker let me talk to the worker you got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we pass and he oppos if you have a child you got a 1 000 child credit that s money in your pocket if you re marri we reduc the marriag penalti the code ought to encourag marriag not discourag marriag we creat a 10 percent bracket to help lower incom american a famili of four make 40 000 receiv about 1 700 in tax relief it s your money the way my oppon talk he said we re go to spend the govern s money no we re spend your money and when you have more money in your pocket you re abl to better afford thing you want i believ the role of govern is to stand side by side with our citizen to help them realiz their dream not tell citizen how to live their live
p3939
aVmy oppon talk about fiscal saniti his record in the unit state senat doe not match his rhetor he vote to increas tax 98 time and to bust the budget 277 time
p3940
aVbob anybodi can play with these vote everybodi know that i have support or vote for tax cut over 600 time i broke with my parti in order to balanc the budget and ronald reagan sign into law the tax cut that we vote for i vote for ira tax cut i vote for small busi tax cut
p3941
aVbut you know whi the pell grant have gone up in their number becaus more peopl qualifi for them becaus they don t have money but they re not get the 5 100 the presid promis them they re get less money there are more peopl who qualifi that s not what we want
p3942
aVsenat no one is play with your vote you vote to increas tax 98 time when they vote when they propos reduc tax you vote against it 126 time you vote to violat the budget cap 277 time you know there s a mainstream in american polit you sit right on the far left bank as a matter of fact your record is such that ted kennedi your colleagu is the conserv senat from massachusett
p3943
aVwill we ever be safe and secur again yes we absolut must be that s the goal now how do we achiev it is the most critic compon of it i believ that this presid regrett rush us into a war made decis about foreign polici push allianc away and as a result america is now bear this extraordinari burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be
p3944
aVyou know bob i don t know i just don t know i do know that we have a choic to make in america and that is to treat peopl with toler and respect and digniti it s import that we do that i also know in a free societi peopl consent adult can live the way they want to live and that s to be honor
p3945
aVbut as we respect someon s right and as we profess toler we shouldn t chang or have to chang our basic view on the sanctiti of marriag i believ in the sanctiti of marriag i think it s veri import that we protect marriag as an institut between a man and a woman
p3946
aVi propos a constitut amend the reason i did so was becaus i was worri that activist judg are actual defin the definit of marriag and the surest way to protect marriag between a man and woman is to amend the constitut it has also the benefit of allow citizen to particip in the process after all when you amend the constitut state legislatur must particip in the ratif of the constitut
p3947
aVi m deepli concern that judg are make those decis and not the citizenri of the unit state you know congress pass a law call doma the defens of marriag act my oppon was against it it basic protect state from the action of one state to anoth it also defin marriag as between a man and a woman but i m concern that that will get overturn and if it get overturn then we ll end up with marriag be defin by court and i don t think that s in our nation s interest
p3948
aVwe re all god s children bob and i think if you were to talk to dick cheney s daughter who is a lesbian she would tell you that she s be who she was she s be who she was born as i think if you talk to anybodi it s not choic i ve met peopl who ve struggl with this for year peopl who were in a marriag becaus they were live a sort of convent and they struggl with it and i ve met wive who are support of their husband or vice versa when they final sort of broke out and allow themselv to live who they were who they felt god had made them i think we have to respect that
p3949
aVthe presid and i share the belief that marriag is between a man and a woman i believ that i believ marriag is between a man and a woman but i also believ that becaus we are the unit state of america we re a countri with a great unbeliev constitut with right that we afford peopl that you can t discrimin in the workplac you can t discrimin in the right that you afford peopl you can t disallow someon the right to visit their partner in a hospit you have to allow peopl to transfer properti which is whi i m for partnership right and so forth
p3950
aVnow with respect to doma and the marriag law the state have alway been abl to manag those law and they re prove today everi state that they can manag them adequ
p3951
aVthe measur is not are we safer the measur is are we as safe as we ought to be and there are a host of option that this presid had avail to him like make sure that at all our port in america contain are inspect onli 95 percent of them 95 percent come in today uninspect that s not good enough peopl who fli on airplan today the cargo hold is not x ray but the baggag is that s not good enough firehous don t have enough firefight in them polic offic are be cut from the street of america becaus the presid decid to cut the cop program
p3952
aVi respect their view i complet respect their view i am a cathol and i grew up learn how to respect those view but i disagre with them as do mani i believ that i can t legisl or transfer to anoth american citizen my articl of faith what is an articl of faith for me is not someth that i can legisl on somebodi who doesn t share that articl of faith i believ that choic is a woman s choic it s between a woman god and her doctor and that s whi i support that
p3953
aVi think it s import to promot a cultur of life i think a hospit societi is a societi where everi be count and everi person matter i believ the ideal world is one in which everi child is protect in law and welcom to life i understand there s great differ on this issu of abort but i believ reason peopl can come togeth and put good law in place that will help reduc the number of abort
p3954
aVtake for exampl the ban on partial birth abort it s a brutal practic peopl from both polit parti came togeth in the hall of congress and vote overwhelm to ban that practic it made a lot of sens my oppon in that he s out of the mainstream vote against that law
p3955
aVso we can do a better job of homeland secur i can do a better job of wage a smarter more effect war on terror and guarante that we go after the terrorist i will hunt them down and we ll kill them we ll captur them we ll do what s ever necessari to be safe but i pledg this to you america i will do it in the way that franklin roosevelt and ronald reagan and john kennedi and other did where we build the strongest allianc where the world join togeth where we have the best intellig and where we are abl ultim to be more safe and secur
p3956
aVwhat i m say is is that as we promot life and promot a cultur of life sure there are way we can work togeth to reduc the number of abort continu to promot adopt law that s a great altern to abort continu to fund and promot matern group home i will continu to promot abstin program at the last debat my oppon said his wife was involv with those program that s great and i appreci that veri much all of us ought to be involv with program that provid a viabl altern to abort
p3957
aVgosh i sure hope it s not the administr
p3958
aVsecond i do believ the lawsuit i don t believ i know that the lawsuit are caus health care cost to rise in america that s whi i m such a strong believ in medic liabil reform at the last debat my oppon said well they onli these lawsuit onli caus cost to go up by one percent well he didn t includ the defens practic of medicin that cost the feder govern some 28 billion a year and cost our societi between 60 and 100 billion dollar a year
p3959
aVthird one of the reason whi there s still high cost in medicin is becaus this is the they don t use inform technolog it s like if you look at the it s the equival of the buggi and hors day compar to other industri here in america and so we ve got to introduc high technolog into health care we re begin to do it we re chang the languag we want there to be electron medic record to cut down on error as well as to reduc cost peopl tell me that when the health care field is fulli integr with inform technolog it will wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system
p3960
aVand final move generic drug to the market quicker so those are four way to help control the cost in health care
p3961
aVthe reason health care cost are get higher one of the princip reason is that this administr has stood in the way of commonsens effort that would have reduc the cost let me give you a prime exampl in the senat we pass the right of american to import drug from canada but the presid and his friend took it out in the hous and now you don t have that right the presid block you from the right to have less expens drug from canada
p3962
aVwe also want medicar to be abl to negoti bulk purchas the va doe that the va provid lower cost drug to our veteran we could have done that in medicar medicar is paid for by the american taxpay medicar belong to you medicar is for senior who are mani of them on fix incom to lift them out of poverti but rather than help you the taxpay have lower cost rather than help senior have less expens drug the presid made it illeg illeg for medicar to actual go out and bargain for lower price result 139 billion windfal profit to the drug compani come out of your pocket that s a larg part of your 17 percent increas in medicar premium when i m presid i m send that back to congress and we re go to get a real prescript drug benefit
p3963
aVi have a better plan for homeland secur i have a better plan to be abl to fight the war on terror by strengthen our militari strengthen our intellig by go after the financ more authorit by do what we need to do to rebuild the allianc by reach out to the muslim world which the presid has almost not done and begin to isol the radic islam muslim not have them isol the unit state of america
p3964
aVthe unit nation kofi annan offer help after baghdad fell and we never pick him up on that and did what was necessari to transfer author and to transfer reconstruct it was alway american run
p3965
aVsecond when we went in there were three countri great britain australia and the unit state that s not a grand coalit we can do better
p3966
aVwell actual he forgot poland and now there are 30 nation involv stand side by side with our american troop and i honor their sacrific and i don t appreci it when a candid for presid denigr the contribut of these brave brave soldier it s you cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contribut of those who are with us he call them the coerc and the bribe that s not how you bring peopl togeth
p3967
aVour coalit is strong it will remain strong for my so long as i m the presid
p3968
aVno what i said was that becaus we achiev such a rapid victori more of the saddam loyalist were around in other word we thought we d whip more of them go in but becaus tommi frank did such a great job in plan the oper we move rapid and a lot of the ba athist and saddam loyalist laid down their arm and disappear i thought we would they would stay and fight but they didn t and now we re fight them now
p3969
aVit s and it s hard work i understand how hard it is i get the casualti report everi day i see on the tv screen how hard it is but it s necessari work and i m optimist see i think you can be realist and optimist at the same time i m optimist we ll achiev i know we won t achiev if we send mix signal i know we re not go to achiev our object if we send mix signal to our troop our friend the iraqi citizen
p3970
aVi know i can do a better job in iraq where i have a plan to have a summit with all of the alli someth this presid has not yet achiev not yet been abl to do to bring peopl to the tabl we can do a better job of train the iraqi forc to defend themselv and i know that we can do a better job of prepar for elect all of these and especi homeland secur which we ll talk about a littl bit later
p3971
aVwe ve got a plan in place the plan say there ll be elect in januari and there will be the plan say we ll train iraqi soldier so they can do the hard work and we are and it s not onli just america but nato is now help jordan is help train polic the uae is help train polic we ve alloc 7 billion over the next month for reconstruct effort and we re make progress there and our allianc is strong now i just told you there s go to be a summit of the arab nation japan will be host a summit we re make progress
p3972
aVit is hard work it is hard work to go from a tyranni to a democraci it s hard work to go from a place where peopl get their hand cut off or execut to a place where peopl are free but it s necessari work and a free iraq is go to make this world a more peac place
p3973
aVwhat i think troubl a lot of peopl in our countri is that the presid has just sort of describ one kind of mistak but what he has said is that even know there were no weapon of mass destruct even know there was no immin threat even know there was no connect of al qaida he would still have done everyth the same way those are his word now i would not
p3974
aVso what i m tri to do is just talk the truth to the american peopl and to the world truth is what good polici is base on it s what leadership is base on
p3975
aVthe presid say that i m denigr these troop i have noth but respect for the british and for toni blair and for what they ve been will to do but you can t tell me that when the most troop ani other countri has on the ground is great britain with 8 300 and below that the 4 other are below 4 000 and below that there isn t anybodi out of the hundr that we have a genuin coalit to get this job done you can t tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it start it was princip the unit state the america and great britain and one or two other that s it and today we are 90 percent of the casualti and 90 percent of the cost
p3976
aVand meanwhil north korea has gotten nuclear weapon talk about mix messag the presid is the one who said we can t allow countri to get nuclear weapon they have i ll chang that
p3977
aVwell i ve never ever use the harshest word as you did just then and i tri not to i ve been but i ll nevertheless tell you that i think he has not been candid with the american peopl and i ll tell you exact how
p3978
aVfirst of all we all know that in his state of the union messag he told congress about nuclear materi that didn t exist we know that he promis america that he was go to build this coalit i just describ the coalit it is not the kind of coalit we were describ when we were talk about vote for this the presid said he would exhaust the remedi of the unit nation and go through that full process he didn t he cut it off sort of arbitrarili and we know that there were further diplomat effort underway they just decid the time for diplomaci is over and rush to war without plan for what happen afterward now he misl the american peopl in his speech when he said we will plan care they obvious didn t he misl the american peopl when he said we d go to war as a last resort we did not go as a last resort and most american know the differ
p3979
aVnow this has cost us deepli in the world i believ that it is import to tell the truth to the american peopl i ve work with those leader the presid talk about i ve work with them for 20 year for longer than this presid and i know what mani of them say today and i know how to bring them back to the tabl
p3980
aVand i believ that fresh start new credibl a presid who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the muslim world to make it clear that this is not you know usama bin laden use the invas of iraq in order to go out to peopl and say the america has declar war on islam we need to be smarter about how we wage a war on terror we need to deni them the recruit we need to deni them the safe haven we need to rebuild our allianc i believ that ronald reagan john kennedi and other did that more effect and i m go to tri to follow in their footstep
p3981
aVmy oppon just said someth amaz he said usama bin laden use the invas of iraq as an excus to spread hatr for america usama bin laden isn t go to determin how we defend ourselv usama bin laden doesn t get to decid the american peopl decid i decid the right action was in iraq
p3982
aVmy oppon call it a mistak it wasn t a mistak he said i misl on iraq i don t think he was mislead when he call iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002 i don t think he was mislead when he said that it was right to disarm iraq in the spring of 2003 i don t think he misl you when he said that if anyon who doubt whether the world was better off without saddam hussein in power didn t have the judgment to be presid i don t think he was mislead i think what is mislead is to say you can lead and succeed in iraq if you keep chang your posit on this war and he has as the polit chang his posit chang and that s not how a command in chief act
p3983
aVi let me finish the intellig i look at was the same intellig my oppon look at the veri same intellig and when i stood up there and spoke to the congress i was speak off the same intellig he look at to make his decis to support the author of forc
p3984
aVi wasn t mislead when i said he was a threat nor was i mislead on the day that the presid decid to go to war when i said that he had made a mistak in not build strong allianc and that i would have prefer that he did more diplomaci i ve had one posit one consist posit that sad dam hussein was a threat there was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way and the presid chose the wrong way
p3985
aVi too thank the univers of miami and say our prayer are with the good peopl of this state who ve suffer a lot
p3986
aVthe onli thing consist about my oppon s posit is that he s been inconsist he chang posit and you cannot chang posit in this war on terror if you expect to win and i expect to win it s necessari we win we re be challeng like never befor and we have a duti to our countri and to futur generat of america to achiev a free iraq a free afghanistan and to rid the world of weapon of mass destruct
p3987
aVno everi life is precious everi life matter you know my hardest the hardest part of the job is to know that i commit the troop in harm s way and then do the best i can to provid comfort for the love one who lost a son or a daughter or a husband and wife
p3988
aVand you know i think about missi johnson who is a fantast young ladi i met in charlott north carolina she and her son bryan they came to see me her husband p j got kill he d been in afghanistan went to iraq you know it s hard work to tri to love her as best as i can know full well that the decis i made caus her love one to be in harm s way i told her after we pray and tear up and laugh some that i thought her husband s sacrific was nobl and worthi becaus i understand the stake of this war on terror i understand that we must find al qaida wherev they hide we must deal with threat befor they fulli materi and saddam hussein was a threat and that we must spread liberti becaus in the long run the way to defeat hatr and tyranni and oppress is to spread freedom missi understood that that s what she told me her husband understood
p3989
aVso you say was it worth it everi life is precious that s what distinguish us from the enemi everybodi matter but i think it s worth it jim i think it s worth it becaus i think i know in the long term a free iraq a free afghanistan will set such a power exampl in the part of the world that s desper for freedom it will help chang the world that we can look back and say we did our duti
p3990
aVi understand what the presid is talk about becaus i know what it mean to lose peopl in combat and the question is it worth the cost remind me of my own think when i came back from fight in that war and it remind me that it is vital for us not to confus the war ever with the warrior that happen befor
p3991
aVand that s one of the reason whi i believ i can get this job done becaus i am determin for those soldier and for those famili for those kid who put their live on the line that is nobl that s the most nobl thing that anybodi can do and i want to make sure the outcom honor that nobil
p3992
aVnow we have a choic here i ve laid out a plan by which i think we can be success in iraq with a summit by do better train faster by cut by do what we need to do with respect to the u n and the elect there s onli 25 percent of the peopl in there they can t have an elect right now the presid is not get the job done
p3993
aVseptemb the 11th chang how america must look at the world and sinc that day our nation has been on a multiprong strategi to keep our countri safer we ve pursu al qaida wherev al qaida tri to hide 75 percent of known al qaida leader have been brought to justic the rest of them know we re after them
p3994
aVso the choic for america is you can have a plan that i ve laid out in four point each of which i can tell you more about or you can go to johnkerri com and see more of it or you have the presid s plan which is four word more of the same i think my plan is better and my plan has a better chanc of stand up and fight for those troop i will never let those troop down and will hunt and kill the terrorist wherev they are
p3995
aVi understand what it mean to be the command in chief and if i were to ever say this is the wrong war at the wrong time at the right wrong place the troop would wonder how can i follow this guy you cannot lead the war on terror if you keep chang posit on the war on terror and say thing like well this is just a grand divers it s not a grand divers this is an essenti that we get it right and so i the plan he talk about simpli won t work
p3996
aVsecretari of state colin powel told this presid the potteri barn rule if you break it you fix it now if you break it you made a mistak it s the wrong thing to do but you own it and then you ve got to fix it and do someth with it now that s what we have to do there s no inconsist
p3997
aVsoldier know over there that this isn t be done right yet i m go to get it right for those soldier becaus it s import to israel it s import to america it s import to the world it s import to the fight on terror but i have a plan to do it he doesn t
p3998
aVthe timelin that i ve set out and again i want to correct the presid becaus he s misl again this even on what i ve said i didn t say i would bring troop out in 6 month i said if we do the thing that i ve set out and we are success we could begin to draw the troop down in 6 month and i think a critic compon of success in iraq is be abl to convinc the iraqi and the arab world that the unit state doesn t have long term design on it
p3999
aVas i understand it we re build some 14 militari base there now and some peopl say they ve got a rather perman concept to them when you when you guard the oil ministri but you don t guard the nuclear facil the messag to a lot of peopl is mayb well mayb they re interest in our oil now the problem is that they didn t think these thing through proper and these are the thing you have to think through
p4000
aVwe ve upheld the doctrin that said if you harbor a terrorist you re equal as guilti as the terrorist and the taliban no longer in power 10 million peopl have regist to vote in afghanistan in the upcom presidenti elect
p4001
aVwhat i want to do is chang the dynam on the ground and you have to do that by begin to not back off of fallujah and other place and send the wrong messag to the terrorist you have to close the border you ve got to show you re serious in that regard but you ve also got to show that you re prepar to bring the rest of the world in and share the stake
p4002
aVi will make a flat statement the unit state of america has no long term design on stay in iraq and our goal in my administr would be to get all of the troop out of there with the minim amount you need for train and logist as we do in some other countri in the world after a war to be abl to sustain the peac but that s how we re go to win the peac by rapid train the iraqi themselv
p4003
aVeven the administr has admit they haven t done the train becaus they came to congress a few week ago and ask for a complet reprogram of the money now what greater admiss is there 16 month afterward oop we haven t done the job we ve got to start to spend the money now will you guy give us permiss to shift it over into train
p4004
aVthere s 100 000 troop train polic guard special unit border patrol there s go to be 125 000 train by the end of this year yes we re get the job done it s hard work everybodi know it s hard work becaus there s a determin enemi that s tri to defeat us
p4005
aVnow my oppon say he s go to tri to chang the dynam on the ground well prime minist allawi was here he is the leader of that countri he s a brave brave man when he came after give a speech to the congress my oppon question his credibl you can t chang the dynam on the ground if you ve critic the brave leader of iraq one of his campaign peopl alleg that prime minist allawi was like a puppet that s no way to treat somebodi who s courag and brave that is tri to lead his countri forward
p4006
aVthe way to make sure that we succeed is to send consist sound messag to the iraqi peopl that when we give our word we will keep our word that we stand with you that we believ you want to be free and i do i believ that the 25 million peopl the vast major long to have elect i reject this notion and i m not suggest that my oppon say it but i reject the notion that some say that if you re muslim you can t be free you don t desir freedom i disagre strong disagre with that
p4007
aVi couldn t agre more that the iraqi want to be free and that they could be free but i think the presid again still hasn t shown how he s go to go about it the right way he has more of the same
p4008
aVnow prime minist allawi came here and he said the terrorist are pour over the border that s allawi s assess the nation intellig assess that was given to the presid in juli said best case scenario more of the same of what we see today worst case scenario civil war i can do better
p4009
aVin iraq we saw a threat and we realiz that after septemb the 11th we must take threat serious befor they fulli materi saddam hussein now sit in a prison cell america and the world are safer for it
p4010
aVyes let me
p4011
aVthe reason whi prime minist allawi said they re come across the border is becaus he recogn that this is a central part of the war on terror they re fight us becaus they re fight freedom they understand that a free afghanistan or a free iraq will be a major defeat for them and those are the stake and that s whi it is essenti we not leav that s whi it s essenti we hold the line that s whi it s essenti we win and we will under my leadership we re go to win this war in iraq
p4012
aVi would hope i never have to i understand how hard it is to commit troop i never want to commit troop i never when i was run when we had the debat in 2000 i never dreamt i would be do that but the enemi attack us jim and i have a solemn duti to protect the american peopl to do everyth i can to protect us
p4013
aVi think that by speak clear and do what we say and not send mix messag it is less like we ll ever have to use troop but a presid must alway be will to use troop it must as a last resort
p4014
aVthe i was hope diplomaci would work in iraq it was fall apart there was no doubt in my mind that saddam hussein was hope that the world would turn a blind eye and if he had been in power in other word we had said let s let the inspector work or let s hope to talk him out mayb an 18th resolut would work he d have been stronger and tougher and the world would have been a lot wors off there s just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day if saddam hussein had been in power
p4015
aVso we use diplomaci everi chanc we get believ me and i i would hope never to have to use forc but by speak clear and send messag that we mean what we say we ve affect the world in a posit way look at libya libya was a threat libya is now peac dismantl it weapon program libya understood that america and other will enforc doctrin and the world is better for it
p4016
aVso to answer your question i would hope we d never have to i think by act firm and decis it will mean it s less like to less like we have to use forc
p4017
aVwe continu to pursu our polici of disrupt those who prolifer weapon of mass destruct libya has disarm the a q khan network has been brought to justic and as well we re pursu a strategi of of freedom around the world becaus i understand free nation will reject terror free nation will answer the hope and aspir of their peopl free nation will help us achiev the peac we all want
p4018
aVjim the presid just said someth extraordinarili reveal and frank veri import in this debat in answer to your question about iraq and send peopl into iraq he just said the enemi attack us saddam hussein didn t attack us usama bin laden attack us al qaida attack us
p4019
aVand when we had usama bin laden corner in the mountain of tora bora 1 000 of his cohort with him in those mountain with the american militari forc nearbi and in the field we didn t use the best train troop in the world to go kill the world s number one crimin and terrorist they outsourc the job to afghan warlord who onli a week earlier had been on the other side fight against us neither of whom trust each other that s the enemi that attack us that s the enemi that was allow to walk out of those mountain that s the enemi that is now in 60 countri with stronger recruit
p4020
aVhe also said saddam hussein would have been stronger that is just factual incorrect two third of the countri was a no fli zone when we start this war we would have had sanction we would have had the u n inspector saddam hussein would have been continu weaken if the presid had shown the patienc to go through anoth round of resolut to sit down with those leader and say what do you need what do you need now how much more will it take to get you to join us we would be in a stronger place today
p4021
aVfirst listen
p4022
aVof cours i know usama bin laden attack us i know that and second to think that anoth round of resolut would have caus saddam hussein to disarm disclos is ludicr in my judgment it just show a signific differ of opinion we tri diplomaci we did our best he was hope to turn a blind eye and yes he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him he had the capabl of make weapon and he would have made weapon
p4023
aVthirti five to forti countri in the world had a greater capabl of make weapon at the moment the presid invad than saddam hussein and while he has been divert with 9 out of 10 activ duti divis of our armi either go to iraq come back from iraq or get readi to go north korea s got nuclear weapon and the world is more danger iran is move toward nuclear weapon and the world is more danger darfur has a genocid the world is more danger i d have made a better choic
p4024
aVthe presid alway has the right and alway has had the right for preemptiv strike that was a great doctrin throughout the cold war and it was alway one of the thing we argu about with respect to arm control no presid through all of american histori has ever cede and nor would i the right to preempt in ani way necessari to protect the unit state of america but if and when you do it jim you ve got to do in a way that pass the test that pass the global test where your countrymen your peopl understand fulli whi you re do what you re do and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitim reason
p4025
aVhere we have our own secretari of state who s had to apolog to the world for the present he made to the unit nation i mean we can rememb when presid kennedi in the cuban missil crisi sent his secretari of state to pari to meet with de gaull and in the middl of the discuss to tell them about the missil in cuba he said here let me show you the photo and de gaull wave them off and said no no no no the word of the presid of the unit state is good enough for me how mani leader in the world today would respond to us as a result of what we ve done in that way
p4026
aVso what is at test here is the credibl of the unit state of america and how we lead the world iran and iraq are now more iran and north korea are now more danger now whether preemption is ultim what has to happen or not i don t know yet but i ll tell you this as presid i ll never take my eye off that ball i ve been fight for prolifer the entir time antiprolifer the entir time i ve been in the congress and we ve watch this presid actual turn away from some of the treati that were on the tabl you don t help yourself with other nation when you turn away from the global warm treati for instanc or when you refus to deal at length with the unit nation you have to earn that respect and i think we have a lot of earn back to do
p4027
aVlet me i m not exact sure what you mean pass the global test you take preemptiv action if you pass a global test my attitud is you take preemptiv action in order to protect the american peopl that you act in order to make this countri secur
p4028
aVmy oppon talk about me not sign certain treati but let me tell you one thing i didn t sign and i think it show a differ of our opinion the differ of opinion and that is that i wouldn t join the intern crimin court this is a bodi base in the hagu where unaccount judg and prosecutor could pull our troop our diplomat up for trial and i wouldn t join it and i understand that in certain capit around the world that that wasn t a popular move but it s the right move not to join a foreign court that could where our peopl could be prosecut my oppon is for join the intern crimin court i just think tri to be popular kind of in the global sens if it s not in our best interest make no sens i m interest in work with other nation and do a lot of it but i m not go to make decis that i think are wrong for america
p4029
aVnorth korea first i do let me say i certain hope so befor i was sworn in the polici of this govern was to have bilater negoti with north korea and we sign an agreement with north korea that my administr found out that was not be honor by the north korean and so i decid that a better way to approach the issu was to get other nation involv just besid us
p4030
aVand in crawford texa jiang zemin and i agre that the nuclear weapon free north peninsula korean peninsula was in his interest and our interest and the world s interest and so we began a new dialog with north korea one that includ not onli the unit state but now china and china has got a lot of influenc over north korea in some way more than we do
p4031
aVas well we includ south korea japan and russia so now there are five voic speak to kim chong il not just one and so if kim chong il decid again to not honor an agreement he s not onli do injustic to america he d be do injustic to china as well and i think this will work it s not go to work if we open up a dialog with kim chong il that s what he want he want to unravel the six parti talk or the five the five nation coalit that s send him a clear messag
p4032
aVon iran i hope we can do the same thing continu to work with the world to convinc the iranian mullah to abandon their nuclear ambit we ve work veri close with the foreign minist of franc germani and great britain who have been the folk deliv the messag to the mullah that if you expect to be part of the world of nation get rid of your nuclear program the iaea is involv there s a special protocol recent been pass that allow for instant inspect i hope we can do it and we ve got a good strategi
p4033
aVwith respect to iran the british french and german were the one who initi an effort without the unit state regrett to begin to tri to move to deter the nuclear possibl in iran
p4034
aVi believ we could have done better i think the unit state should have offer the opportun to provid the nuclear fuel test them to see whether or not they were actual look for it for peac purpos if they weren t will to work a deal then we could have put sanction togeth the presid did noth
p4035
aVwith respect to north korea the real stori we had inspector and televis camera in the nuclear reactor in north korea secretari bill perri negoti that under presid clinton and we knew where the fuel rod were and we knew the limit on their nuclear power colin powel our secretari of state announc one day that we were go to continu the dialog and work with the north korean the presid revers him public while the presid of south korea was here and the presid of south korea went back to south korea bewild and embarrass becaus it went against his polici and for 2 year this administr didn t talk at all to north korea
p4036
aVwhile they didn t talk at all the fuel rod came out the inspector were kick out the televis camera were kick out and today there are four to seven nuclear weapon in the hand of north korea that happen on this presid s watch now that i think is one of the most serious sort of revers or mix messag that you could possibl send
p4037
aVright
p4038
aVno i don t believ it s go to happen i believ i m go to win becaus the american peopl know i know how to lead i ve shown the american peopl i know how to lead i have i understand everybodi in this countri doesn t agre with the decis that i ve made and i made some tough decis but peopl know where i stand peopl out there listen know what i believ and that s how best it is to keep the peac
p4039
aVboth i want bilater talk which put all of the issu from the armistic of 1952 the econom issu the human right issu the artilleri dispos issu the dmz issu and the nuclear issu on the tabl
p4040
aVthe minut we have bilater talk the six parti talk will unwind it s exact what kim chong il want and by the way the breach on the agreement was not to plutonium the breach on the agreement is high enrich uranium that s what we caught him do that s where he was break the agreement
p4041
aVsecond you said my oppon said that he d work to put sanction on iran we ve alreadi sanction iran we can t sanction them anymor there are sanction in place on iran and final we were a parti to the convinc to work with germani franc and great britain to send their foreign minist into iran
p4042
aVwell i ll tell you exact whi not but i first want to say someth about those sanction on iran onli the unit state put the sanction on alon and that s exact what i m talk about in order for the sanction to be effect we should have been work with the british french and german and other countri and that s the differ between the presid and me and there again he sort of slid by the question
p4043
aVnow with respect to darfur yes it is a genocid and month ago mani of us were press for action i think the reason that we re not say send american troop in at this point is sever fold number one we can do this through the african union provid we give them the logist support right now all the presid is provid is humanitarian support we need to do more than that they ve got to have the logist capac to go in and stop the kill and that s go to requir more than is on the tabl today
p4044
aVi also believ that it is one of the reason we can t do it is we re overextend ask the peopl in the arm forc today we ve got guard and reserv who are do doubl duti we ve got a backdoor draft take place in america today peopl with stop loss program where they re told you can t get out of the militari 9 out of our 10 activ duti divis commit to iraq one way or the other either go come or prepar so this is the way the presid has overextend the unit state
p4045
aVthis nation of our has got a solemn duti to defeat this ideolog of hate and that s what they are this is a group of killer who will not onli kill here but kill children in russia that will attack unmerci in iraq hope to shake our will we have a duti to defeat this enemi we have a duti to protect our children and grandchildren the best way to defeat them is to never waver to be strong to use everi asset at our dispos is to constant stay on the offens and at the same time spread liberti
p4046
aVthat s whi in my plan i add two activ duti divis to the unit state armi not for iraq but for our general demand across the globe i also intend to doubl the number of special forc so that we can do the job we need to do with respect to fight the terrorist around the world and if we do that then we have the abil to be abl to respond more rapid but i ll tell you this as presid if it took american forc to some degre to coalesc the african union i d be prepar to do it becaus we could never allow anoth rwanda it s a moral respons for us in the world
p4047
aVback to iran just for a second it was not my administr that put the sanction on iran that happen long befor i arriv in washington dc
p4048
aVin term of darfur i agre it s genocid and colin powel so state we have commit 200 million worth of aid we re the lead donor in the world to help the suffer peopl there we will commit more over time to help
p4049
aVwe were veri much involv at the u n on the sanction polici of the bashir govern in the sudan prior to darfur ambassador jack danforth had been negoti a north south agreement that we would hope would have brought peac to the sudan i agre with my oppon that we shouldn t be commit troop that we ought to be work with the african union to do so precis what we did in liberia we help stabil the situat with some troop and when the african union came we move them out my hope is that the african union move rapid to help save live fortun the raini season will be end short which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long suffer peopl there
p4050
aVwhew that s a load question
p4051
aVfirst of all i admir senat kerri s servic to our countri i admir the fact that he is a great dad i appreci the fact that his daughter have been so kind to my daughter in what has been a pretti hard experi for i guess young girl see their dad out there campaign i admir the fact that he s serv for 20 year in the senat although i m not so sure i admir the record i won t hold it against him that he went to yale noth wrong with that
p4052
aVi my concern about the senat is that in the cours of this campaign i ve been listen veri care to what he say and he chang his posit on the war in iraq chang his posit on someth as fundament as what you believ in your core in your heart of heart is right in iraq you cannot lead if you send mix messag mix messag send the wrong signal to our troop mix messag send the wrong signal to our alli mix messag send the wrong signal to the iraqi citizen
p4053
aVand that s what peopl are see now is happen in afghanistan ten million citizen have regist to vote it s a phenomen statist that if given a chanc to be free they will show up at the poll forti one percent of those 10 million are women
p4054
aVand that s my biggest concern about my oppon i admir his servic but i just know how this world work and that in the council of govern there must be certainti from the u s presid of cours we chang tactic when need to but we never chang our belief the strateg belief that are necessari to protect this countri in the world
p4055
aVwell first of all i appreci enorm the person comment the presid just made and i share them with him i think onli if you ve if you re do this and he s done it more than i have in term of the presid can you begin to get a sens of what it mean to your famili and it s tough and so i acknowledg his daughter i ve watch them i ve chuckl a few time at some of their comment
p4056
aVi m tri to put a leash on them
p4057
aVwell i know i ve learn not to do that
p4058
aVthank you
p4059
aVand a great first ladi but we do have differ i m not go to talk about a differ of charact i don t think that s my job or my busi but let me talk about someth that the presid just sort of finish up with mayb someon would call it a charact trait mayb somebodi wouldn t but this issu of certainti it s one thing to be certain but you can be certain and be wrong it s anoth to be certain and be right or be certain and be move in the right direct or be certain about a principl and then learn new fact and take those new fact and put them to use in order to chang and get your polici right
p4060
aVwhat i worri about with the presid is that he s not acknowledg what s on the ground he s not acknowledg the realiti of north korea he s not acknowledg the truth of the scienc of stem cell research or of global warm and other issu and certainti sometim can get you in troubl
p4061
aVwell i think listen i fulli agre that one should shift tactic and we will in iraq our command have got all the flexibl to do what is necessari to succeed but what i won t do is chang my core valu becaus of polit or becaus of pressur and it is one of the thing i ve learn in the white hous is that there s enorm pressur on the presid and you cannot wilt under that pressur otherwis the world won t be better off
p4062
aVin iraq no doubt about it it s tough it s hard work it s incred hard you know whi becaus an enemi realiz the stake the enemi understand a free iraq will be a major defeat in their ideolog of hatr that s whi they re fight so vocifer they show up in afghanistan when they were there becaus they tri to beat us and they didn t and they re show up in iraq for the same reason they re tri to defeat us and if we lose our will we lose but if we remain strong and resolut we will defeat this enemi
p4063
aVi have no intent of wilt i ve never wilt in my life and i ve never waver in my life i know exact what we need to do in iraq and my posit has been consist saddam hussein is a threat he need to be disarm we need to go to the u n the presid need the author to use forc in order to be abl to get him to do someth becaus he never did it without the threat of forc but we didn t need to rush to war without a plan to win the peac
p4064
aVnuclear prolifer nuclear prolifer there are some 600 plus ton of unsecur materi still in the former soviet union in russia at the rate that the presid is current secur that it will take 13 year to get it
p4065
aVi did a lot of work on this i wrote a book about it sever year ago mayb 6 or 7 year ago call the new war which saw the difficulti of this intern crimin network and back then we intercept a suitcas in a middl eastern countri with nuclear materi in it and the black market sale price was about 250 million now there are terrorist tri to get their hand on that stuff today
p4066
aVand this presid i regret to say has secur less nuclear materi in the last 2 year sinc 9 11 than we did in the 2 year preced 9 11 we have to do this job and to do the job you can t cut the money for it the presid actual cut the money for it you have to put the money into it and the fund and the leadership
p4067
aVand part of that leadership is send the right messag to place like north korea right now the presid is spend hundr of million of dollar to research bunker bust nuclear weapon the unit state is pursu a new set of nuclear weapon it doesn t make sens you talk about mix messag we re tell other peopl you can t have nuclear weapon but we re pursu a new nuclear weapon that we might even contempl use
p4068
aVnot this presid i m go to shut that program down and we re go to make it clear to the world we re serious about contain nuclear prolifer and we re go to get the job of contain all of that nuclear materi in russia done in 4 year and we re go to build the strongest intern network to prevent nuclear prolifer this is the scale of what presid kennedi set out to do with the nuclear test ban treati it s our generat s equival and i intend to get it done
p4069
aVactual we ve increas fund for deal with nuclear prolifer about 35 percent sinc i ve been the presid
p4070
aVsecond we ve set up what s call the well first of all i agre with my oppon that the biggest threat face this countri is weapon of mass destruct in the hand of a terrorist network and that s whi we ve put prolifer as the one of the centerpiec of a multiprong strategi to make the countri safer
p4071
aVmy administr start what is call the prolifer secur initi over 60 nation involv with disrupt the tran shipment of inform and or weapon of mass destruct materi and we re been effect we bust the a q khan network this was a prolifer out of pakistan that was sell secret to place like north korea and libya we convinc libya to disarm it was an essenti part of deal with weapon of mass destruct and prolifer
p4072
aVi ll tell you anoth way to help protect america in the long in the long run is continu with missil defens and we ve got a robust research and develop program that has been ongo dure my administr we ll be implement a missil defens system relat quick and that is anoth way to help deal with the threat that we face in the 21st centuri my oppon is oppos to the missil defens
p4073
aVin the hand of a terrorist enemi
p4074
aVweapon of mass destruct nuclear prolifer but again the test of the differ between us the presid has had 4 year to tri to do someth about it and north korea has got more weapon iran is move toward weapon and at his pace it will take 13 year to secur those weapon in russia i m go to do it in 4 year and i m go to immedi set out to have bilater talk with north korea
p4075
aVagain i can t tell you how big a mistak i think that is to have bilater talk with north korea it s precis what kim chong il want it will caus the six parti talk to evapor it mean that china no longer is involv in convinc along with us for kim chong il to get rid of his weapon it s a big mistak to do that we must have china s leverag on kim chong il besid ourselv and if you enter bilater talk they ll be happi to walk away from the tabl i don t think that will work
p4076
aVi believ in be strong and resolut and determin and i will hunt down and kill the terrorist wherev they are but we also have to be smart jim and smart mean not divert your attent from the real war on terror in afghanistan against usama bin laden and take it off to iraq where the 9 11 commiss confirm there was no connect to 9 11 itself and saddam hussein and where the reason for go to war was weapon of mass destruct not the remov of saddam hussein
p4077
aVno i don t think it s okay and said so public i think that there need to be check and balanc in a democraci and made that veri clear that by consolid power in a central govern he s send a signal to the western world and the unit state that that perhap he doesn t believ in check and balanc and i ve told him that
p4078
aVhe s also a strong alli in the war on terror he is listen they went through a horribl situat in beslan where these terrorist gun down young school kid but it s the natur of the enemi by the way that s whi we need to be firm and resolv in bring them to justic it s precis what vladimir putin understand as well
p4079
aVi ve got a good relat with vladimir and it s import that we do have a good relat becaus that enabl me to better comment to him and to better to discuss with him some of the decis he make i found that in this world that it s import to establish good person relationship with peopl so that when you have disagr you re abl to disagre in a way that is effect
p4080
aVand so i ve told him my opinion i look forward to discuss it more with him as time goe on russia is a countri in transit vladimir is go to have to make some hard choic and i think it s veri import for the american presid as well as other western leader to remind him of the great benefit of democraci that democraci will best help the peopl realiz their hope and aspir and dream and i will continu work with him over the next 4 year
p4081
aVwell let me just say quick that i ve had an extraordinari experi of watch up close and person that transit in russia becaus i was there right after the transform and i was probabl one of the first senat along with senat bob smith of new hampshir a former senat to go down into the kgb underneath treblinka squar and see ream of file with name in them and it sort of brought home the transit to democraci that russia was tri to make
p4082
aVi regret what s happen in these past month and i think it goe beyond just the respons to terror mr putin now control all the televis station his polit opposit is be put in jail and i think it s veri import for the unit state obvious to have a work relationship that is good this is a veri import countri to us and we want a partnership but we alway have to stand up for democraci as georg will said the other day freedom on the march not in russia right now
p4083
aVnow i d like to come back for a quick moment if i can to that issu about china and the talk becaus that s one of the most critic issu here north korea just becaus the presid say it can t be done that you d lose china doesn t mean it can t be done i mean this is the presid who said there were weapon of mass destruct said mission accomplish said we could fight the war on the cheap none of which were true we can have bilater talk with kim chong il and we can get those weapon at the same time as we get china becaus china has an interest in the outcom too
p4084
aVthis presid has made i regret to say a coloss error of judgment and judgment is what we look for in the presid of the unit state of america
p4085
aVyou know my opinion on north korea i can t say it ani more plain
p4086
aVpardon me
p4087
aVoh i m a pretti calm guy
p4088
aVbut you know look we look at the same intellig we came to the same conclus that saddam hussein was a grave threat and i don t hold it against him that he said grave threat i m not go to go around the countri say he didn t tell the truth when he look at the same intellig i did
p4089
aVit was a threat that s not the issu the issu is what you do about it the presid said he was go to build a true coalit exhaust the remedi of the u n and go to war as a last resort those word realli have to mean someth and unfortun he didn t go to war as a last resort now we have this incred mess in iraq 200 billion it s it s not what the american peopl thought they were get when they vote
p4090
aVi m proud that import militari figur are support me in this race former chairman of joint chief of staff john shalikashvili just yesterday general eisenhow s son general john eisenhow endors me general admir william crow general toni mcpeak who ran the air forc war so effect for his father all believ i would make a stronger command in chief and they believ it becaus they know i would not take my eye off of the goal usama bin laden unfortun he escap in the mountain of tora bora we had him surround but we didn t use american forc the best train in the world to go kill him the presid reli on afghan warlord that he outsourc that job to that s wrong
p4091
aVthank you jim veri much thank you veri much to the univers again thank you mr presid
p4092
aVmy fellow american as i said at the veri begin of this debat both presid bush and i love this countri veri much there is no doubt i think about that but we have a differ set of convict about how we make our countri stronger here at home and respect again in the world
p4093
aVi know that for mani of you sit at home parent of kid in iraq you want to know who is the person who could be a command in chief who can get your kid home and get the job done and win the peac and for all the rest of the parent in america who are wonder about their kid go to a school or anywher els in the world what kind of world they re go to grow up in let me look you in the eye and say to you i ve defend this countri as a young man in war and i will defend it as presid of the unit state but i have a differ with this presid i believ we re strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong allianc i have a plan for iraq i believ we can be success i m not talk about leav i m talk about win and we need a fresh start a new credibl a presid who can bring alli to our side
p4094
aVi also have a plan to win the war on terror fund homeland secur strengthen our militari cut off financ reach out to the world again build strong allianc
p4095
aVi believ america s best day are ahead of us becaus i believ that the futur belong to freedom not to fear that s the countri that i m go to fight for and i ask you to give me the opportun to make you proud i ask you to give me the opportun to lead this great nation so that we can be stronger here at home respect again in the world and have respons leadership that we deserv
p4096
aVthank you and god bless america
p4097
aVthank you veri much tonight jim thank you senat
p4098
aVif america show uncertainti or weak in this decad the world will drift toward tragedi that s not go to happen so long as i m your presid in the next 4 year we will continu to strengthen our homeland defens we will strengthen our intellig gather servic we will reform our militari the militari will be an all volunt armi we will continu to stay on the offens we will fight the terrorist around the world so we do not have to face them here at home
p4099
aVwe ll continu to build our allianc i ll never turn over america s nation secur need to leader of other countri as we continu to build those allianc and we ll continu to spread freedom i believ in the transform power of liberti i believ that a free iraq is in this nation s interest i believ a free afghanistan is in this nation s interest and i believ both a free afghanistan and a free iraq will serv as a power exampl for million who plead in silenc for liberti in the broader middl east
p4100
aVwe ve done a lot of hard work togeth over the last 3 1 2 year we ve been challeng and we ve risen to those challeng we ve climb the mighti mountain i see the valley below and it s a valley of peac by be steadfast and resolut and strong by keep our word by support our troop we can achiev the peac we all want
p4101
aVi appreci your listen tonight i ask for your vote and may god continu to bless our great land
p4102
aVwell where do you want me to begin
p4103
aVnow onc there we could have continu those inspect we had saddam hussein trap
p4104
aVhe also promis america that he would go to war as a last resort those word mean someth to me as somebodi who has been in combat last resort you ve got to be abl to look in the eye of famili and say to those parent i tri to do everyth in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter i don t believ the unit state did that and we push our alli asid
p4105
aVand so today we are 90 percent of the casualti and 90 percent of the cost 200 billion 200 billion that could have been use for health care for school for construct for prescript drug for senior and it s in iraq and iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror the center is afghanistan where incident there were more american kill last year than the year befor where the opium product is 75 percent of the world s opium product where 40 to 60 percent of the economi of afghanistan is base on opium where the elect have been postpon 3 time the presid move the troop so he s got 10 time the number of troop in iraq than he has in afghanistan where usama bin laden is doe that mean that saddam hussein was 10 time more import than usama bin laden excus me saddam hussein more import than usama bin laden i don t think so
p4106
aVmy oppon look at the same intellig i look at and declar in 2002 that saddam hussein was a grave threat he also said in decemb of 2003 that anyon who doubt that the world is safer without saddam hussein doe not have the judgment to be presid i agre with him the world is better off without saddam hussein
p4107
aVi was hope diplomaci would work i understand the serious consequ of commit our troop into harm s way it s the hardest decis a presid make so i went to the unit nation i didn t need anybodi to tell me to go to the unit nation i decid to go there myself and i went there hope that onc and for all the free world would act in concert to get saddam hussein to listen to our demand and they pass a resolut that said disclos disarm or face serious consequ i believ when an intern bodi speak it must mean what it say
p4108
aVbut saddam hussein had no intent of disarm whi should he he had 16 other resolut and noth took place as a matter of fact my oppon talk about inspector the fact are that he was systemat deceiv the inspector that wasn t go to work that s kind of a pre septemb 10th mental to hope that somehow resolut and fail inspect would make this world a more peac place he was hope we d turn away but there was fortun other besid myself who believ that we ought to take action and we did the world is safer without saddam hussein
p4109
aVjim we ve got the capabl of do both as a matter of fact this is a global effort we re face a a group of folk who have such hatr in their heart they ll strike anywher with ani mean and that s whi it s essenti that we have strong allianc and we do that s whi it s essenti that we make sure that we keep weapon of mass destruct out of the hand of peopl like al qaida which we are but to say that there s onli one focus on the war on terror doesn t realli understand the natur of the war on terror
p4110
aVof cours we re after saddam hussein i mean bin laden he s he s isol seventi five percent of his peopl have been brought to justic the killer in the mastermind of the septemb the 11th attack khalid sheik mohammad is in prison we re make progress but the front on this war is more than just one place the philippin we ve got help we re help them there to bring to bring al qaida affili to justic there and of cours iraq is a central part of the war on terror that s whi zarqawi and his peopl are tri to fight us their hope is that we grow weari and we leav the biggest disast that could happen is that we not succeed in iraq we will succeed we ve got a plan to do so and the main reason we ll succeed is becaus the iraqi want to be free
p4111
aVi had the honor of visit with prime minist allawi he s a strong courag leader he believ in the freedom of the iraqi peopl he doesn t want u s leadership howev to send mix signal to not stand with the iraqi peopl he believ like i believ that the iraqi are readi to fight for their own freedom they just need the help to be train there will be elect in januari we re spend reconstruct money and our allianc is strong that s the plan for victori and when iraq is free america will be more secur
p4112
aVthe presid just talk about iraq as a center of the war on terror iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror befor the presid invad it the presid made the judgment to divert forc from under general tommi frank from afghanistan befor the congress even approv it to begin to prepar to go to war in iraq and he rush to war in iraq without a plan to win the peac
p4113
aVnow that is not the judgment that a presid of the unit state ought to make you don t take america to war unless you have a plan to win the peac you don t send troop to war without the bodi armor that they need i ve met kid in ohio parent in wisconsin place iowa where they re go out on the internet to get the state of the art bodi gear to send to their kid some of them have got them for a birthday present i think that s wrong humve 10 000 out of 12 000 humve that are over there aren t armor and you go visit some of those kid in the hospit today who were maim becaus they don t have the armament
p4114
aVthis presid just i don t know if he see what s realli happen out there but it s get wors by the day more soldier kill in june than befor more in juli than june more in august than juli more in septemb than in august and now we see behead and we ve got weapon of mass destruct cross the border everi singl day and they re blow peopl up and we don t have enough troop there
p4115
aVcan i respond
p4116
aVthank you sir
p4117
aVfirst of all what my oppon want you to forget is that he vote to author the use of forc and now say it s the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place i don t see how you can lead this countri to succeed in iraq if you say wrong war wrong time wrong place what messag doe that send our troop what messag doe that send our alli what messag doe that send the iraqi
p4118
aVno the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolv and to follow through on the plan that i ve just outlin
p4119
aVyes we have to be steadfast and resolv and i am and i will succeed for those troop now that we re there we have to succeed we can t leav a fail iraq but that doesn t mean it wasn t a mistak of judgment to go there and take the focus off of usama bin laden it was now we can succeed but i don t believ this presid can i think we need a presid who has the credibl to bring the alli back to the tabl and to do what s necessari to make it so america isn t do this alon
p4120
aVjim let me tell you exact what i ll do and there are a long list of thing first of all what kind of mix messag doe it send when you ve got 500 million go over to iraq to put polic offic in the street of iraq and the presid is cut the cop program in america what kind of messag doe it send to be send money to open firehous in iraq but we re shut firehous who are the first respond here in america
p4121
aVthe presid hasn t put one nickel not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnel and bridg and most expos subway system that s whi they had to close down the subway in new york when the republican convent was there we hadn t done the work that ought to be done the presid 95 percent of the contain that come into the port right here in florida are not inspect civilian get onto aircraft and their their luggag is x ray but the cargo hold is not x ray doe that make you feel safer in america
p4122
aVthis presid thought it was more import to give the wealthiest peopl in america a tax cut rather than invest in homeland secur those aren t my valu i believ in protect america first and long befor presid bush and i get a tax cut and that s who get it long befor we do i m go to invest in homeland secur and i m go to make sure we re not cut cop program in america and we re fulli staf at our firehous and that we protect the nuclear and chemic plant the presid also unfortun gave in to the chemic industri which didn t want to do some of the thing necessari to strengthen our chemic plant exposur
p4123
aVand there s an enorm undon job to protect the loos nuclear materi in the world that are abl to get to terrorist that s a whole other subject but i see we still have a littl bit more time let me just quick say at the current pace the presid will not secur the loos materi in the soviet union former soviet union for 13 year i m go to do it in 4 year and we re go to keep it out of the hand of terrorist
p4124
aVi don t think we want to get to how he s go to pay for all these promis it s like a huge tax gap and anyway that s for anoth debat
p4125
aVmy administr has tripl the amount of money we re spend on homeland secur to 30 billion a year my administr work with the congress to creat the depart of homeland secur so we could better coordin our border and port we ve got 1 000 extra border patrol on the southern border more than 1 000 on the northern border we re modern our border we ve spent 3 1 billion for fire and polic 3 1 billion we re do our duti to provid the fund
p4126
aVbut the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offens we have to be right 100 percent of the time and the enemi onli has to be right onc to hurt us there s a lot of good peopl work hard and by the way we ve also chang the cultur of the fbi to have counterterror as it number one prioriti we re communic better we re go to reform our intellig servic to make sure that we get the best intellig possibl the patriot act is vital it s vital that the congress renew the patriot act which enabl our law enforc to disrupt terrorist cell
p4127
aVbut again i repeat to my fellow citizen the best way to protect you is to stay on the offens
p4128
aVthe presid just said the fbi had chang it cultur we just read on the front page of america s paper that there are over 100 000 hour of tape unlisten to on one of those tape may be the enemi be right the next time and the test is not whether you re spend more money the test is are you do everyth possibl to make america safe we didn t need that tax cut america need to be safe
p4129
aVof cours we re do everyth we can to protect america i wake up everi day think about how best to protect america that s my job i work with director mueller of the fbi he come into my offic when i m in washington everi morn talk about how to protect us there s a lot of realli good peopl work hard to do so it s hard work
p4130
aVbut again i want to tell the american peopl we re do everyth we can at home but you better have a presid who chase these terrorist down and bring them to justic befor they hurt us again
p4131
aVyes i do but befor i answer further let me thank you for moder i want to thank the univers of miami for host us and i know the presid will join me in welcom all of florida to this debat you ve been through the roughest week anybodi could imagin our heart go out to you and we admir your pluck and persever
p4132
aVlet me first tell you that the best way for iraq to be safe and secur is for iraqi citizen to be train to do the job and that s what we re do we got 100 000 train now 125 000 by the end of this year over 200 000 by the end of next year that is the best way we ll never succeed in iraq if the iraqi citizen do not want to take matter into their own hand and protect themselv i believ they want to prime minist allawi believ they want to
p4133
aVand so the best indic about when we can bring our troop home which i realli want to do but i don t want to do so for the sake of bring them home i want to do so becaus we ve achiev an object is to see the iraqi perform is to see the iraqi step up and take respons
p4134
aVand so the answer to your question is when our general on the ground and ambassador negropont tell me that iraq is readi to defend herself from these terrorist that elect will have been held by then that there s stabil and that they re on their way to you know a nation of that s free that s when and i hope it s as soon as possibl but i know put artifici deadlin won t work my oppon one time said well get me elect i ll have them out of there in 6 month that s you can t do that and expect to win the war on terror
p4135
aVmy messag to our troop is thank you for what you re do we re stand with you strong we ll give you all the equip you need and we ll get you home as soon as the mission s done becaus this is a vital mission a free iraq will be a alli in the war on terror and that s essenti a free iraq will set a power exampl in the part of the world that is desper for freedom a free iraq will help secur israel a free iraq will enforc the hope and aspir of the reform in place like iran a free iraq is essenti for the secur of this countri
p4136
aVthank you jim my messag to the troop is also thank you for what they re do but it s also help is on the way i believ those troop deserv better than what they are get today you know it s interest when i was in the ropelin just the other day come out here from wisconsin a coupl of young returne were in the line one activ duti one from the guard and they both look at me and said we need you you ve got to help us over there
p4137
aVnow i believ there s a better way to do this you know the presid s father did not go into iraq into baghdad beyond basra and the reason he didn t is he said he wrote in his book becaus there was no viabl exit strategi and he said our troop would be occupi in a bitter hostil land that s exact where we find ourselv today there s a sens of american occup
p4138
aVthe onli build that was guard when the troop went into baghdad was the oil ministri we didn t guard the nuclear facil we didn t guard the foreign offic where you might have found inform about weapon of mass destruct we didn t guard the border almost everi step of the way our troop have been left on these extraordinarili difficult mission i know what it s like to go out on one of those mission where you don t know what s around the corner and i believ our troop need other alli help i m go to hold that summit i will bring fresh credibl a new start and we will get the job done right
p4139
aVi can make america safer than presid bush has made us and i believ presid bush and i both love our countri equal but we just have a differ set of convict about how you make america safe i believ america is safest and strongest when we are lead the world and when we are lead strong allianc
p4140
aVjim
p4141
aVi think it s worthi for a followup
p4142
aVif you don t mind
p4143
aVlet s chang the rule we can add a whole
p4144
aVall right my oppon say help is on the way but what kind of messag doe it say to our troop in harm s way wrong war wrong place wrong time that s not a messag a command in chief give or this is a great divers as well help is on the way but it s certain hard to tell it when he vote against the 87 billion supplement to provid equip for our troop and then said he actual did vote for it befor he vote against it that s not what command in chief doe when you re tri to lead troop
p4145
aVwell you know when i talk about the 87 billion i made a mistak in how i talk about the war but the presid made a mistak in invad iraq which is wors i believ that when you know someth s go wrong you make it right that s what i learn in vietnam when i came back from that war i saw that it was wrong some peopl don t like the fact that i stood up to say no but i did and that s what i did with that vote and i m go to lead those troop to victori
p4146
aVi ll never give a veto to ani countri over our secur but i also know how to lead those allianc this presid has left them in shatter across the globe and we re now 90 percent of the casualti in iraq and 90 percent of the cost i think that s wrong and i think we can do better
p4147
aVno and they don t have to provid we have the leadership that we put that i m offer i believ that we have to win this the presid and i have alway agre on that and from the begin i did vote to give the author becaus i thought saddam hussein was a threat and i did accept that that intellig but i also laid out a veri strict seri of thing we need to do in order to proceed from the posit of strength and the presid in fact promis them he went to cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said we will plan care we will proceed cautious we will not make war inevit we will go with our alli he didn t do ani of those thing
p4148
aVthey didn t do the plan they left the plan of the state depart on the state depart desk they avoid even the advic of their own general general shinseki the armi chief of staff said you re go to need sever hundr thousand troop instead of listen to him they retir him the terror czar who has work for everi presid sinc ronald reagan said invad iraq in respons to 9 11 would be like franklin roosevelt invad mexico in respons to pearl harbor that s what we have here
p4149
aVand what we need now is a presid who understand how to bring these other countri togeth to recogn their stake in this they do have stake in it they ve alway had stake in it the arab countri have a stake in not have a civil war the european countri have a stake in not have total disord on their doorstep but this presid hasn t even held the kind of statesmanlik summit that pull peopl togeth and get them to invest in those stake in fact he s done the opposit he push them away when the secretari general kofi annan offer the unit nation he said no no we ll go do this alon
p4150
aVto save for halliburton the spoil of the war they actual issu a memorandum from the defens depart say if you weren t with us in the war don t bother appli for ani construct that s not a way to invit peopl
p4151
aVthat s total absurd of cours the u n was invit in and we support the u n effort there they pull out after sergio de mello got kill but they re now back in help with elect my oppon say we didn t have ani alli in this war what s he say to toni blair what s he say to aleksand kwasniewski of poland i mean you can t expect to build an allianc when you denigr the contribut of those who are serv side by side with american troop in iraq
p4152
aVplus he say the cornerston of his plan to succeed in iraq is to call upon nation to serv so what s the messag go to be pleas join us in iraq for a grand divers join us for a war that is a wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time i know how these peopl think i deal with them all the time i sit down with the world leader frequent and talk to them on the phone frequent they re not go to follow somebodi who say this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time they re not go to follow somebodi whose core convict keep chang becaus of polit in america
p4153
aVand final he say we ought to have a summit well there are summit be held japan is go to have a summit for the donor there s 14 billion pledg and prime minist koizumi is go to call countri to account to get them to contribut and there s go to be an arab summit of the neighborhood countri and colin powel help set up that summit
p4154
aVi m go to give you a tax cut the presid gave the top one percent of incom earner in america got 89 billion last year more than the 80 percent of peopl who earn 100 000 or less all put togeth i think that s wrong that s not wishi washi and that s what i m fight for you
p4155
aVdaniel i don t support a draft but let me tell you where the presid s polici have put us the presid and this is one of the reason whi i m veri proud in this race to have the support of general john shalikashvili former chairman of the joint chief of staff admir william crow former chairman of the joint chief of staff general toni mcpeak who ran the air war for the presid s father and did a brilliant job support me general wes clark who won the war in kosovo support me becaus they all and general baca who was the head of the nation guard support me whi becaus they understand that our militari is overextend under this presid
p4156
aVour guard and reserv have been turn into almost activ duti you ve got peopl do two and three rotat you ve got stop loss polici so peopl can t get out when they were suppos to you ve got a backdoor draft right now and a lot of our militari are underpaid these are famili that get hurt it hurt the middl class it hurt communiti becaus these are our first respond and they re call up and they re over there not over here
p4157
aVnow i m go to add 40 000 activ duti forc to the militari and i m go to make peopl feel good about be safe in our militari and not overextend becaus i m go to run a foreign polici that actual doe what presid reagan did and presid eisenhow did and other we re go to build allianc we re not go to go unilater we re not go to go alon like this presid did
p4158
aVlet me just i ve got to answer this
p4159
aVlet me just answer what he just said about go alon
p4160
aVyou tell toni blair we re go alon tell toni blair we re go alon tell silvio berlusconi we re go alon tell aleksand kwasniewski of poland we re go alon we ve got 30 countri there it denigr an allianc to say we re go alon to discount their sacrific you cannot lead an allianc if you say you re go alon and peopl listen they re sacrif with us
p4161
aVmr presid countri are leav the coalit not join eight countri have left it if missouri just given the number of peopl from missouri who are in the militari over there today were a countri it would be the third largest countri in the coalit behind great britain and the unit state that s not a grand coalit nineti percent of the casualti are american nineti percent of the cost are come out of your pocket i could do a better job my plan doe a better job and that s whi i ll be a better command in chief
p4162
aVthank you veri much ann i ve ask in my secur brief whi that is and i can t go into all the answer et cetera but let me say this to you this presid and his administr have told you and all of us it s not a question of when it s a question of excus me not a question of if it s a question of when we ve been told that the when i can t tell you between the world trade center bomb in what was it 1993 or so and the next time was 5 year 7 year these peopl wait they ll plan they plot
p4163
aVi agre with the presid that we have to go after them and get them wherev they are i just think i can do that far more effect becaus the most import weapon in do that is intellig you ve got to have the best intellig in the world and in order to have the best intellig in the world to know who the terrorist are and where they are and what they re plot you ve got to have the best cooper you ve ever had in the world
p4164
aVnow to go back to your question nikki we re not get the best cooper in the world today we ve got a whole bunch of countri that pay a price for deal with the unit state of america now i m go to chang that
p4165
aVand i m go to put in place a better homeland secur effort look at it 95 percent of our contain come into this countri are not inspect today when you get on an airplan your cart your bag is x ray but the cargo hold isn t x ray do you feel safer this presid in the last debat said that well that would be a big tax gap if we did that ladi and gentlemen it s his tax plan he chose a tax cut for the wealthiest american over get that equip out into the homeland as fast as possibl we have bridg and tunnel that aren t be secur chemic plant nuclear plant that aren t secur hospit that are overcrowd in their emerg room if we had a disast today could they handl it
p4166
aVthis presid chose a tax cut over homeland secur wrong choic
p4167
aVcharli thank you and thank our panelist senat thank you i can and thank washington u as well
p4168
aVthat s an odd thing to say sinc we ve tripl the homeland secur budget from 10 to 30 billion dollar listen we ll do everyth we can to protect the homeland my oppon is right we need good intellig it s also a curious thing for him to say sinc right after 1993 he vote to cut the intellig budget by 7 5 billion
p4169
aVthe best way to defend america in this world we live in is to stay on the offens we ve got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home and they ve got to be right onc and that s the realiti and there s a lot of good peopl work hard we re do the best we possibl can to share inform that s whi the patriot act was import the patriot act is vital by the way it s a tool that law enforc now use to be abl to talk between each other my oppon say he hasn t chang his posit on it no but he s for weaken it
p4170
aVi don t think my oppon has got the right view about the world to make us safe i realli don t first of all i don t think he can succeed in iraq and if iraq were to fail it would be a haven for terrorist and there would be money and the world would be much more danger i don t see how you can win in iraq if you don t believ we should be there in the first place i don t see how you can lead troop if you say it s the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time i don t see how the iraqi are go to have confid in the american presid if all they hear is that it was a mistak to be there in the first place
p4171
aVthis war is a long long war and it requir steadfast determin and it requir a complet understand that we not onli chase down al qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe haven as well as peopl who could provid the terrorist with support
p4172
aVwell the presid and his expert have told america that it s not a question of if it s a question of when and i accept what the presid has said these terrorist are serious they re dead and they know noth except tri to kill i understand that that s whi i will never stop at anyth to hunt down and kill the terrorist
p4173
aVbut you heard the presid just say to you that we ve ad money folk the test is not if you ve ad money the test is have you done everyth possibl to make america secur he chose a tax cut for wealthi american over the thing that i list to you
p4174
aVwell we ll talk about the tax cut for middl class here in a minut but yes i m worri i m worri i m worri about our countri and all i can tell you is everi day i know that there s peopl work overtim do the veri best they can and the reason i m worri is becaus there s a vicious enemi that has an ideolog of hate and the way to defeat them long term by the way is to spread freedom liberti can chang habit and that s what s happen in afghanistan and iraq
p4175
aVi can see whi peopl at your workplac think he chang posit a lot becaus he doe he said he vote for the 87 billion and or vote against it right befor he vote for it and that send a confus signal to peopl he said he thought saddam hussein was a grave threat and now said it was a mistak to remov saddam hussein from power no i can see whi peopl think that he chang posit quit often becaus he doe
p4176
aVi haven t yet i just want to make sure they re safe when a drug come in from canada i want to make sure it cure you and doesn t kill you and that s whi the fda and that s whi the surgeon general are look veri care to make sure it can be done in a safe way i ve got an oblig to make sure our govern doe everyth we can to protect you and one of my worri is that it look like it s from canada and it might be from a third world we ve just got to make sure befor somebodi think they re buy a product that it work and that s whi we re do what we re do now it may veri well be here in decemb you hear me say i think there s a safe way to do it
p4177
aVother way to make sure drug are cheaper one is to speed up generic drug to the marketplac quicker pharmaceut were use loophol to keep brand drug in place and generic are much less expens than brand drug and we re do just that anoth is to get our senior to sign up for these drug discount card and they re work wanda blackmor i met here from missouri the first time she bought drug with her drug discount card she paid 1 14 i think it was for about 10 worth of drug these card make sens
p4178
aVand you know in 2006 senior are go to get prescript drug coverag for the first time in medicar becaus i went to washington to fix problem medicar the issu of medicar use to be call medi scare peopl didn t want to touch it for fear of get hurt polit i want to get someth done i think our senior deserv a modern medic system and in 2006 our senior will get prescript drug coverag
p4179
aVthank you for ask
p4180
aVjohn you heard the presid just say that he thought he might tri to be for it four year ago right here in this forum he was ask the same question can t peopl be abl to import drug from canada do you know what he said i think that make sens i think that s a good idea 4 year ago
p4181
aVnow the presid said i m not block that ladi and gentlemen the presid just didn t level with you right now again he did block it becaus we pass it in the unit state senat we sent it over to the hous that you could import drug we took care of the safeti issu we re not talk about third world drug we re talk about drug made right here in the unit state of america that have american brand name on them in american bottl and we re ask they be abl to allow you to get them the presid block it
p4182
aVyou know for a while he was a strong support of get rid of saddam hussein he saw the wisdom until the democrat primari came along and howard dean the antiwar candid began to gain on him and he chang posit i don t see how you can lead this countri in a time of war in a time of uncertainti if you chang your mind becaus of polit
p4183
aVthe presid also took medicar which belong to you and he could have lower the cost of medicar and lower your tax and lower the cost to senior you know what he did he made it illeg illeg for medicar to do what the va doe which is bulk purchas drug so that you could lower the price and get them out to you lower he put 139 billion of windfal profit into the pocket of the drug compani right out of your pocket
p4184
aVthat s the differ between us the presid side with the power compani the oil compani the drug compani and i m fight to let you get those drug from canada and i m fight to let medicar surviv i m fight for the middl class that s the differ
p4185
aVif they re safe they re come i want to remind you that it wasn t just my administr that made the decis on safeti presid clinton did the same thing becaus we have an oblig to protect you
p4186
aVnow he talk about medicar he s been in the unit state senat 20 year show me one accomplish toward medicar that he accomplish i ve been in washington dc 3 1 2 year and led the congress to reform medicar so our senior have got a modern health care system that s what leadership is all about
p4187
aVactual mr presid in 1997 we fix medicar and i was one of the peopl involv in it we not onli fix medicar and took it way out into the futur we did someth that you don t know how to do we balanc the budget and we paid down the debt of our nation for 2 year in a row and we creat 23 million new job at the same time and it s the presid s fiscal polici that have driven up the biggest deficit in american histori he s ad more debt to the debt of the unit state in 4 year than all the way from georg washington to ronald reagan put togeth go figur
p4188
aVveri easili john edward is the author of the patient bill of right he want to give peopl right john edward and i support tort reform we both believ that as lawyer i m a lawyer too and i believ that we will be abl to get a fix that has elud everybodi els becaus we know how to do it it s in my health care propos go to johnkerri com you can pull it off the internet and you ll find a tort reform plan
p4189
aVhe just brought up the tax cut you rememb we increas that child credit by 1000 reduc the marriag penalti creat a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower incom american that s right at the middl class he vote against it and yet he tell you he s for a middl class tax cut it s you ve got to be consist when you re the presid there s a lot of pressur and you ve got to be firm and consist
p4190
aVnow ladi and gentlemen import to understand the presid and his friend tri to make a big deal out of it is it a problem yes it s a problem do we need to fix it particular for ob gyn and for brain surgeon and other yes but it s less than one percent of the total cost of health care your premium are go up
p4191
aVyou ve gone up in missouri about 3 500 you ve gone up 64 percent you ve seen co pay go up deduct go up everyth has gone up five million peopl have lost their health insur under this presid and he s done noth about it
p4192
aVi have a plan i have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you i have a plan to cover all children i have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senat and congressmen give themselv i have a plan that s go to allow peopl 55 to 64 to buy into medicar earli and i have a plan that will take the catastroph case out of the system off your back pay for it out of a feder fund which lower the premium for everybodi in america make american busi more competit and make health care more afford
p4193
aVnow all of that can happen but i have to ask you to do one thing join me in roll back the presid s unafford tax cut for peopl earn more than 200 000 a year that s all nineti eight percent of america i m give you a tax cut and i m give you health care
p4194
aVlet me see where to start here first the nation journal name senat kerri the most liber senat of all and that s say someth in that bunch you might say that took a lot of hard work
p4195
aVthe reason i bring that up is becaus he s propos 2 2 trillion in new spend and he say he s go to tax the rich to close the tax gap he can t he s go to tax everybodi here to fund his program that s just realiti
p4196
aVand what are his health program first he say he s for medic liabil reform particular for ob gyn there was a bill on the floor of the unit state senat that he could have show up and vote for if he s so much for it second he say that medic liabil cost onli caus one percent increas that show a lack of understand doctor practic defens medicin becaus of all the frivol lawsuit that cost our govern 28 billion a year
p4197
aVand final he say he s go to have a novel health care plan you know what it is the feder govern is go to run it it is the largest increas in feder govern health care ever and it fit with his philosophi that s whi i told you about the award he won from the nation journal that s what liber do they creat govern sponsor health care mayb you think that make sens i don t govern sponsor health care would lead to ration it would ruin the qualiti of health care in america
p4198
aVyes i think we should look at the punit and we should have some limit but look what s realli import charli is the presid s just tri to scare everybodi here with throw label around i mean compassion conserv what doe that mean cut 500 000 kid from after school program cut 365 000 kid from health care run up the biggest deficit in american histori mr presid you re bat 0 for 2 i mean serious label don t mean anyth what mean someth is do you have a plan and i want to talk about my plan some more i hope we can
p4199
aVwhat doe matter is the plan he said he is for you re now for cap punit damag that s odd you should have shown up on the floor in the senat and vote for it then medic liabil issu are a problem a signific problem he s been in the unit state senat for 20 year and he hasn t address it we pass it out of the hous of repres guess where it stuck it stuck in the senat becaus the trial lawyer won t act on it and he put a trial lawyer on the ticket
p4200
aVright thank you for that we have a deficit we have a deficit becaus this countri went into a recess you might rememb the stock market start to declin dramat 6 month befor i came to offic and then the bubbl of the 1990s pop and that cost us rev enu that cost us revenu
p4201
aVsecond we re at war and i m go to spend what it take to win the war more than just 120 billion for iraq and afghanistan we ve got to pay our troop more we have we ve increas money for ammunit and weapon and pay and homeland secur i just told this ladi over here we spent went from 10 to 30 billion dollar to protect the homeland i think we have an oblig to spend that kind of money
p4202
aVplus we cut tax for everybodi everybodi got tax relief so that they d get out of the recess i think if you rais tax dure a recess you head to depress i come from the school of thought that say when peopl have more money in their pocket dure tough econom time it increas demand or invest small busi begin to grow and job are ad we found out today that over the past 13 month we ve ad 1 9 million new job in the last 13 month i propos a plan detail budget that show us cut the deficit in half by 5 year
p4203
aVand you re right i haven t veto ani spend bill becaus we work togeth non homeland non defens discretionari spend was rise at 15 percent a year when i got into offic and today it s less than one percent becaus we re work togeth to tri to bring this deficit under control like you i m concern about the deficit but i am not go to shortchang our troop in harm s way and i m not go to run up tax which will cost this economi job
p4204
aVthank you for your question
p4205
aVlet me begin by say that my health care plan is not what the presid describ it is not a govern takeov you have choic choos your doctor choos your plan the govern has noth to do with it in fact it doesn t ask you to do anyth if you don t want to take it you don t have to if you like your high premium you keep them that s the way we leav it
p4206
aVnow with respect to the deficit the presid was hand a 5 6 trillion surplus ladi and gentlemen that s where he was when he came into offic we now have a 2 6 trillion deficit this is the biggest turnaround in the histori of the countri he s the first presid in 72 year to lose job he talk about war this is the first time the unit state of america has ever had a tax cut when we re at war franklin roosevelt harri truman other knew how to lead they knew how to ask the american peopl for the right thing
p4207
aVone percent of america the highest one percent of incom earner in america got 89 billion of tax cut last year one percent of america got more than the 80 percent of america that earn from 100 000 down the presid think it s more import to fight for that top one percent than to fight for fiscal respons and to fight for you
p4208
aVi want to put money in your pocket i am i have a propos for a tax cut for all peopl earn less than the 200 000 the onli peopl affect in my plan are the top incom earner of america
p4209
aVlook at the budget one is make sure congress doesn t overspend but let me talk back about where we ve been the stock market was declin 6 month prior to my arriv it was the largest stock market correct one of the largest in histori which foretold a recess becaus we cut tax on everybodi rememb we ran up the child credit by 1 000 we reduc the marriag penalti we creat the 10 percent bracket everybodi who pay tax got relief the recess was one of the shortest in our nation s histori
p4210
aVafter 9 11 after the recess had end the presid ask for anoth tax cut and promis 5 6 million job would be creat he lost 1 6 million ladi and gentlemen and most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest peopl in the countri he came and ask for a tax cut we want a tax cut to kick the economi into gear do you know what he present us with a 25 billion giveaway to the biggest corpor in america includ a 254 million refund check to enron wrong prioriti you are my prioriti
p4211
aVabsolut yes right into the camera yes i am not go to rais tax i have a tax cut and here s my tax cut i rais the child care credit by 1 000 for famili to help them be abl to take care of their kid i have a 4 000 tuition tax credit that goe to parent and kid if they re earn for themselv to be abl to pay for colleg and i lower the cost of health care in the way that i describ to you
p4212
aVeveri part of my program i ve shown how i m go to pay for it and i ve gotten good peopl like former secretari of the treasuri bob rubin for instanc who show how to balanc budget and give you a good economi to help me crunch these number and make them work i ve even scale back some of my favorit program alreadi like the child care program i want to fund and the nation servic program becaus the presid s deficit keep grow and i ve said as a pledg i m go to cut the deficit in half in 4 year
p4213
aVnow i m go to restor what we did in the 1990s ladi and gentlemen pay as you go we re go to do it like you do it the presid broke the pay as you go rule somebodi here ask the question about whi haven t you veto someth it s a good question if you care about it whi don t you veto it i think john mccain call the energi bill the no lobbyist left behind bill i mean you ve got to stand up and fight somewher folk
p4214
aVit s just not credibl when he talk about be fiscal conserv it s just not credibl if you look at his record in the senat he vote to break the spend the cap the spend cap over 200 time and here he say he s go to be a fiscal conserv all of a sudden it s just not credibl you cannot believ it
p4215
aVand of cours he s go to rais your tax you see he s propos 2 2 trillion of new spend and so they said well how are you go to pay for it he said well he s go to rais the tax on the rich that s what he said the top two bracket that rais he say 800 billion we say 600 billion we ve got battl green eyeshad somewher in between those number and so there is a differ what he s promis and what he could rais now either he s go to break all these wonder promis he s told you about or he s go to rais tax and i suspect given his record he s go to rais tax
p4216
aVis my time up yet
p4217
aVkeep go good
p4218
aVyou look at me like my clock was up
p4219
aVi think that the way to grow this economi is to keep tax low is to have an energi plan is to have litig reform as i told you we just got a report that said over the past 13 month we ve creat 1 9 million new job we re grow and so the fundament question of this campaign is who s go to keep the economi grow so peopl can work that s the fundament question
p4220
aVwell first of all the presid s figur of 2 2 trillion just aren t accur those are the fuzzi math figur put togeth by some group that work for the campaign that s not the number
p4221
aVnumber two john mccain and i have a propos joint for a commiss that close corpor giveaway loophol we ve got 40 billion go to bermuda we ve got all kind of giveaway we ought to be shut those down
p4222
aVand third credibl ladi and gentlemen in 1985 i was one of the first democrat to move to balanc the budget i vote for the balanc budget in 93 and 97 we did it we did it and i was there
p4223
aVyes i mean he s got a record he s been there for 20 year you can run but you can t hide he vote 98 time to rais tax i mean these aren t make up figur and so peopl are go to have to look at the record look at the record of the man run for the presid they don t name him the most liber in the unit state senat becaus he hasn t shown up to mani meet they name him becaus of his vote and it s realiti it s just not credibl to say he s go to keep tax down and balanc budget
p4224
aVoff road diesel engin we have reach an agreement to reduc pollut from off road diesel engin by 90 percent i ve got a plan to increas the wetland by 3 million we ve got an aggress brownfield program to refurbish inner citi sore spot to use piec of properti
p4225

p4226
aVwe propos and pass a healthi forest bill which was essenti to work with particular in western state to make sure that our forest were protect what happen in those forest becaus of lousi feder polici is they grow to be they are not they re not harvest they re not taken care of and as a result they re like tinder box and over the last summer i ve flown over there and so this is a reason polici to protect old stand of tree and at the same time make sure our forest aren t vulner to the forest fire that have destroy acr after acr in the west we ve got a good commonsens polici
p4227
aVnow i m go to tell you what i realli think is go to happen over time is technolog is go to chang the way we live for the good for the environ so i propos a hydrogen automobil a hydrogen generat automobil we re spend a billion dollar to come up with the technolog to do that
p4228
aVthat s whi i m a big propon of clean coal technolog to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way i guess you d say i m a good steward of the land the qualiti of the air is cleaner sinc i ve been the presid fewer water complaint sinc i ve been the presid more land be restor sinc i ve been the presid
p4229
aVeach situat is differ robin and obvious we hope that diplomaci work befor you ever use forc the hardest decis a presid make is ever to use forc
p4230
aVthank you for your question
p4231
aVboy to listen to that the presid i don t think is live in a world of realiti with respect to the environ now if you re a red sox fan that s okay but if you re a presid it s not let me just say to you number one don t throw the label around label don t mean anyth i support welfar reform i led the fight to put 100 000 cop on the street of america i ve been for faith base initi help to interven in the live of young children for year i was broke with my parti in 1985 one of the first three democrat to fight for a balanc budget when it was heresi label don t fit ladi and gentlemen
p4232
aVnow when it come to the issu of the environ this is one of the worst administr in modern histori the clear sky bill that he just talk about it s one of those orwellian name you pull out of the sky slap it onto someth like no child left behind but you leav million of children behind here they re leav the sky and the environ behind
p4233
aVif they just left the clean air act all alon the way it is today no chang the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the cleaner sky act we re go backward in fact his environment enforc chief air qualiti person at the epa resign in protest over what they re do to what are call the new sourc perform standard for air qualiti they re go backward on the definit for wetland they re go backward on the water qualiti they pull out of the global warm declar it dead didn t even accept the scienc i m go to be a presid who believ in scienc
p4234
aVwell had we join the kyoto treati which i guess he s refer to it would have cost america a lot of job it s one of these deal where in order to be popular in the hall of europ you sign a treati but i thought it would cost a lot of i think there s a better way to do it and i just told you the fact sir the qualiti of the air is cleaner sinc i ve been the presid of the unit state and we ll continu to spend money on research and develop becaus i truli believ that s the way to get from how we live today to be abl to live a standard of live that we re accustom to and be abl to protect our environ bet ter the use of technolog
p4235
aVthe fact is that the kyoto treati was flaw i was in kyoto and i was part of that i know what happen but this presid didn t tri to fix it he just declar it dead ladi and gentlemen and we walk away from the work of 160 nation over 10 year you wonder nikki whi it is that peopl don t like us in some part of the world you just say hey we don t agre with you goodby the presid has done noth to tri to fix it i will
p4236
aVafter 9 11 we had to look at the world differ after 9 11 we had to recogn that when we saw a threat we must take it serious befor it come to hurt us in the old day we d see a threat and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not but 9 11 chang it all
p4237
aVjane there are a lot of way to be competit and unfortun again i regret this administr has not seiz them and embrac them let me give you an exampl there s a tax loophol right now if you re a compani in st loui work tri to make job here there s actual an incent for you to go away you get more money you can keep more of your tax by go abroad i m go to shut that loophol and i m go to give the tax benefit to the compani that stay here in america to help make them more competit
p4238
aVsecond we re go to creat a manufactur job credit and a new job credit for peopl to be abl to help hire and be more competit here in america
p4239
aVthird what s realli hurt american busi more than anyth els is the cost of health care now you didn t hear ani plan from the presid becaus he doesn t have a plan to lower the cost of health care five million american have lost their health care 620 000 missourian have no health care at all 96 000 missourian have lost their health care under presid bush
p4240
aVi have a plan to cover those folk and it s a plan that lower cost for everybodi cover all children and the way i pay for it i m not fiscal irrespons is i roll back the tax cut that this presid so fierc want to defend the one for him and me and charli i think you ought to get the break i want to lower your cost of health care
p4241
aVi want to fulli fund educ no child left behind special need educ and that s how we re go to be more competit by make sure our kid are graduat from school and colleg china and india are graduat more graduat in technolog and scienc than we are we ve got to creat the product of the futur
p4242
aVthat s whi i have a plan for energi independ within 10 year and we re go to put our laboratori and our colleg and univers to work and we re go to get the great entrepreneuri spirit of this countri and we re go to free ourselv from this depend on mideast oil that s how you creat job and becom competit
p4243
aVlet me start with how to control the cost of health care medic liabil reform for starter which he s oppos second allow small busi to pool togeth so they can share risk and buy insur at the same discount big busi get to do third spread what s call health save account it s good for small busi good for owner you own your own account you can save tax free you get a catastroph plan to help you own it this is differ from say okay let me incent you to go on the govern
p4244
aVi vow to our countrymen that i would do everyth i could to protect the american peopl that s whi we re bring al qaida to justic seventi five percent of them have been brought to justic that s whi i said to afghanistan if you harbor a terrorist you re just as guilti as the terrorist and the taliban is no longer in power and al qaida no longer has a place to plan
p4245
aVhe s talk about his plan to keep job here you know he call it an outsourc to keep stop outsourc robert rubin look at his plan and said it won t work the best way to keep job here in america is one have an energi plan i propos one to the congress 2 year ago it encourag conserv encourag technolog to explor for environment friend way for coal and use coal and gas it encourag the use of renew like ethanol and biodiesel it s stuck in the senat he and his runningm didn t show up to vote when they could have got it go in the senat less regul if we want job here legal reform if we want job here and we ve got to keep tax low
p4246
aVnow he say he s onli go to tax the rich do you realiz 900 000 small busi will be tax under his plan becaus most small busi are subchapt s corp or limit partnership and they pay tax at the individu incom tax level and so when you re run up the tax like that you re tax job creator and that s not how you keep job here
p4247
aVyou can t stop all outsourc charli i ve never promis that i m not go to becaus that would be pander you can t but what you can do is creat a fair play field and that s what i m talk about
p4248
aVbut let me just address what the presid just said ladi and gentlemen that s just not true what he said the wall street journal said 96 percent of small busi are not affect at all by my plan and you know whi he get that count the presid got 84 from a timber compani that he own and he s count as a small busi dick cheney is count as a small busi that s how they do thing that s just not right
p4249
aVi own a timber compani that s news to me
p4250
aVmost small busi are subchapt s corp they just are i met grant milliron mansfield ohio he s creat job most small busi 70 percent of the new job in america are creat by small busi his tax are go up when you run up the top two bracket it s a fact
p4251
aVand i saw a uniqu threat in saddam hussein as did my oppon becaus we thought he had weapon of mass destruct and the uniqu threat was that he could give weapon of mass destruct to an organ like al qaida and the harm they inflict on us with airplan would be multipli great by weapon of mass destruct and that was a serious serious threat
p4252
aVyes i appreci that i realli don t think your right are be water down as a matter of fact i wouldn t support it if i thought that everi action be taken against terrorist requir a court order requir scrutini as a matter of fact the tool now given to the terrorist fighter are the same tool that we ve been use against drug dealer and white collar crimin so i realli don t think so i hope you don t think that i mean i becaus i think whoever is the presid must guard your liberti must not erod your right in america
p4253
aVthe patriot act is necessari for exampl becaus part of the fbi couldn t talk to each other intellig gather and the law enforc arm of the fbi just couldn t share intellig under the old law and that didn t make ani sens our law enforc must have everi tool necessari to find and disrupt terrorist at home and abroad befor they hurt us again that s the task of the 21st centuri
p4254
aVand so i don t think the patriot act abridg your right at all and i know it s necessari i can rememb be in upstat new york talk to fbi agent that help bust the lackawanna cell up there and they told me they could not have perform their duti the duti we all expect of them if they did not have the abil to communic with each other under the patriot act
p4255
aVformer governor racicot as chairman of the republican parti said he thought that the patriot act has to be chang and fix congressman jim sensenbrenn he s the chairman of the hous judiciari committe has said over his dead bodi befor it get renew without be thorough recheck whole bunch of folk in america concern about the way the patriot act has been appli
p4256
aVin fact the inspector general of the justic depart found that john ashcroft had twice appli it in way that were inappropri peopl s right have been abus i met a man who spent 8 month in prison wasn t even allow to call his lawyer wasn t allow to final senat dick durbin of illinoi interven and was abl to get him out this is in our countri folk the unit state of america they ve got sneak and peak search that are allow they ve got peopl allow to go into church now and polit meet without ani show of potenti crimin activ or otherwis
p4257
aVnow i vote for the patriot act nineti nine unit state senat vote for it and the presid has been veri busi run around the countri use what i just describ to you as a reason to say i m wishi washi that i m a flip flopper now that s not a flip flop i believ in the patriot act we need the thing in it that coordin the fbi and the cia we need to be stronger on terror but you know what we also need to do as american is never let the terrorist chang the constitut of the unit state in a way that disadvantag our right
p4258
aVso i tri diplomaci i went to the unit nation but as we learn in the same report i quot saddam hussein was game the oil for food programm to get rid of sanction he was tri to get rid of sanction for a reason he want to restart his weapon program
p4259
aVyou know elizabeth i realli respect your the feel that s in your question i understand it i know the moral that s prompt that question and i respect it enorm but like nanci reagan and so mani other peopl you know i was at a forum with michael j fox the other day in new hampshir who s suffer from parkinson s and he want us to do stem cell embryon stem cell and this fellow stood up and he was quiver his whole bodi was shake from the nerv diseas the muscular diseas that he had and he said to me and to the whole hall he said you know don t take away my hope becaus my hope is what keep me go chris reev is a friend of mine chris reev exercis everi singl day to keep those muscl aliv for the day when he believ he can walk again and i want him to walk again
p4260
aVi think we can save live now i think we can do ethic guid embryon stem cell research we have 100 000 to 200 000 embryo that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertil clinic these weren t taken from abort or someth like that they re from a fertil clinic and they re either go to be destroy or left frozen and i believ if we have the option which scientist tell us we do of cure parkinson s cure diabet cure some kind of a parapleg or quadripleg or a spinal cord injuri anyth that s the natur of the human spirit i think it is respect life to reach for that cure i think it is respect life to do it in an ethic way
p4261
aVand the presid s chosen a polici that make it imposs for our scientist to do that i want the futur and i think we have to grab it
p4262
aVembryon stem cell research requir the destruct of life to creat a stem cell i m the first presid ever to allow fund feder fund for embryon stem cell research i did so becaus i too hope that we ll discov cure from the stem cell and from the research deriv
p4263
aVbut i think we ve got to be veri care in balanc the ethic and the scienc and so i made the decis we wouldn t spend ani more money beyond the 70 line 22 of which are now in action becaus scienc is import but so is ethic so is balanc life to destroy life to save life is one of the real ethic dilemma that we face
p4264
aVthere is go to be hundr of experi off the 22 line that now exist that are activ and hope we find a cure but as well we need to continu to pursu adult stem cell research i help doubl the nih budget to 28 billion a year to find cure and the approach i took is one that i think is a balanc and necessari approach to balanc scienc and the concern for life
p4265
aVwhen you talk about walk a waffl line he say he s allow it which mean he s go to allow the destruct of life up to a certain amount and then he isn t go to allow it now i don t know how you draw that line but let me tell you pointblank the line of stem cell that he s made avail everi scientist in the countri will tell you not adequ becaus they re contamin by mous cell and becaus there aren t 60 or 70 there are onli about 11 to 20 now and there aren t enough to be abl to do the research becaus they re contamin
p4266
aVwe ve got to open up the possibl of this research and when i am presid i m go to do it becaus we have to
p4267
aVwe all thought there was weapon there robin my oppon thought there was weapon there that s whi he call him a grave threat i wasn t happi when we found out there wasn t weapon and we ve got an intellig group togeth to figur out whi but saddam hussein was a uniqu threat and the world is better off without him in power and my oppon s plan lead me to conclud that saddam hussein would still be in power and the world would be more danger
p4268
aVlet me make sure you understand my decis those stem cell line alreadi exist the embryo had alreadi been destroy prior to my decis i had to make the decis do we destroy more life do we continu to destroy life i made the decis to balanc scienc and ethic
p4269
aVi m not tell
p4270
aVlet me give you a coupl of exampl i guess of the kind of person i wouldn t pick i wouldn t pick a judg who said that the pledg of allegi couldn t be said in a school becaus it had the word under god in it i think that s an exampl of a judg allow person opinion to enter into the decisionmak process as oppos to strict interpret of the constitut
p4271
aVthank you sir
p4272
aVthank you charli a few year ago when he came to offic the presid said these are his word what we need are some good conserv judg on the court and he said also that his two favorit justic are justic scalia and justic thoma so you get a pretti good sens of where he s head if he were to appoint somebodi
p4273
aVnow here s what i believ i don t believ we need a good conserv judg and i don t believ we need a good liber judg i don t believ we need a good judg of that kind of definit on either side i subscrib to the justic potter stewart standard he was a justic on the suprem court of the unit state and he said the mark of a good judg a good justic is that when you re read their decis their opinion you can t tell if it s written by a man or a woman a liber or a conserv a muslim a jew or a christian you just know you re read a good judici decis
p4274
aVwhat i want to find if i m privileg to have the opportun to do it and the suprem court of the unit state is at stake in this race ladi and gentlemen the futur of thing that matter to you in term of civil right what kind of justic depart you ll have whether we ll enforc the law will we have equal opportun will women s right be protect will we have equal pay for women which is go backward will a woman s right to choos be protect these are constitut right and i want to make sure we have judg who interpret the constitut of the unit state accord to the law
p4275
aVi would say to that person exact what i will say to you right now first of all i cannot tell you how deepli i respect the belief about life and when it begin i m a cathol rais a cathol i was an altar boy religion has been a huge part of my life it help lead me through a war lead me today but i can t take what is an articl of faith for me and legisl it for someon who doesn t share that articl of faith whether they be agnost atheist jew protest whatev i can t do that
p4276
aVbut i can counsel peopl i can talk reason about life and about respons i can talk to peopl as my wife teresa doe about make other choic and about abstin and about all these other thing that we ought to do as a respons societi but as a presid i have to repres all the peopl in the nation and i have to make that judgment
p4277
aVnow i believ that you can take that posit and not be pro abort but you have to afford peopl their constitut right and that mean be smart about allow peopl to be fulli educ to know what their option are in life and make certain that you don t deni a poor person the right to be abl to have whatev the constitut afford them if they can t afford it otherwis
p4278
aVthat s whi i think it s import that s whi i think it s import for the unit state for instanc not to have this rigid ideolog restrict on help famili around the world to be abl to make a smart decis about famili plan you ll help prevent aid you ll help prevent unwant children unwant pregnanc you ll actual do a better job i think of pass on the moral respons that is express in your question and i truli respect it
p4279
aVtri to deciph that
p4280
aVi think it is a worthi goal in america to have everi child protect by law and welcom in life i also think we ought to continu to have good adopt law as an altern to abort and we need to promot matern group home which my administr has done cultur of life is realli import for a countri to have if it s go to be a hospit societi
p4281
aVthank you
p4282
aVwell again the presid just said categor my oppon is against this my oppon is against that it s just not that simpl no i m not i m against the partial birth abort but you ve got to have an except for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodili injuri to the mother second with respect to parent notif i m not go to requir a 16 or 17 year old kid who s been rape by her father and who s pregnant to have to notifi her father so you ve got to have a judici intervent and becaus they didn t have a judici intervent where she could go somewher and get help i vote against it it s never quit as simpl as the presid want you to believ
p4283
aVit s pretti simpl when they say are you for a ban on partial birth abort yes or no and he was given a chanc to vote and he vote no and that s just the way it is that s a vote it came right up it s clear for everybodi to see and as i said you can run but you can t hide it s the realiti
p4284
aVput a head fake on
p4285
aVrobin i m go to answer your question i m also go to talk respond to what you ask cheryl at the same time
p4286
aVi have made a lot of decis some of them littl like appoint to a board you ve never heard of and some of them big and in a war there s a lot of tactic decis that historian will look back and say you shouldn t have done that you shouldn t have made that decis and i ll take respons for them i m human
p4287
aVbut on the big question about whether or not we should have gone into afghanistan the big question about whether we should have remov somebodi in iraq i ll stand by those decis becaus i think they re right that s realli what you re when they ask about the mistak that s what they re talk about they re tri to say did you make a mistak go into iraq and the answer is absolut not it was the right decis
p4288
aVthe duelfer report confirm that decis today becaus what saddam hussein was do was tri to get rid of sanction so he could reconstitut a weapon program and the biggest threat face america is terrorist with weapon of mass destruct we knew he hate us we knew he had been a invad other countri we knew he tortur his own peopl
p4289
aVon the tax cut it s a big decis i did the right decis our recess was one of the shallowest in modern histori
p4290
aVnow you ask what mistak i made some mistak in appoint peopl but i m not go to name them i don t want to hurt their feel on nation tv but histori will look back and i m fulli prepar to accept ani mistak that histori judg to my administr becaus the presid make the decis the presid has to take the respons
p4291
aVi believ the presid made a huge mistak a catastroph mistak not to live up to his own standard which was build a true global coalit give the inspector time to finish their job and go through the u n process to it end and go to war as a last resort
p4292
aVthe world is more danger today the world is more danger today becaus the presid didn t make the right judgment now the presid wish that i had chang my mind he want you to believ that becaus he can t come here and tell you that he s creat new job for america he s lost job he can t come here and tell you that he s creat health care for american becaus one point what we ve got 5 million american who have lost their health care 96 000 of them right here in missouri he can t come here and tell you that he s left no child behind becaus he didn t fund no child left behind
p4293
aVi ask each of you just to look into your heart look into your gut gut check time was this realli go to war as a last resort the presid rush our nation to war without a plan to win the peac and simpl thing weren t done that s whi senat lugar say incompet in the deliveri of servic that s whi senat hagel republican say beyond piti beyond embarrass in the zone of danger
p4294
aVwe didn t guard 850 000 ton of ammo that ammo is now be use against our kid ten thousand out of twelv thousand humve aren t armor i ve visit some of those kid with no limb today becaus they didn t have the armor on those vehicl they didn t have the right bodi armor i ve met parent who ve on the internet gotten the armor to send their kid
p4295
aVthere s no bigger judgment for a presid of the unit state than how you take a nation to war and you can t say becaus saddam might have done it 10 year from now that s a reason that s an excus
p4296
aVhe complain about the fact our troop don t have adequ equip yet he vote against the 87 billion supplement i sent to the congress and then issu one of the most amaz quot in polit histori i actual did vote for the 87 billion befor i vote against it
p4297
aVsaddam hussein was a risk to our countri ma am and he was a risk that and this is where we just have a differ of opinion the truth of the matter is if you listen care saddam would still be in power if he were the presid of the unit state and the world would be a lot better off
p4298
aVnot necessarili be in power but here s what i ll say about the 87 billion i made a mistak in the way i talk about it he made a mistak in invad iraq which is a wors decis
p4299
aVnow i vote the way i vote becaus i saw that he had the polici wrong and i want account i didn t want to give a slush fund to halliburton i also thought the wealthiest peopl in america ought to pay for it ladi and gentlemen he want your kid to pay for it i want us to pay for it sinc we re at war i don t think that s a bad decis
p4300
aVso what doe he do he s tri to attack me he want you to believ that i can t be presid and he s tri to make you believ it becaus he want you to think i chang my mind
p4301
aVgo ahead actual

aVeither way
p4304
aVthank you charli thank you and thank you all thank you all of you for take part thank for your question tonight veri veri much
p4305
aVobvious the presid and i both have veri strong convict i respect him for that but we have a veri differ view about how to make america stronger and safer i will never cede the author of our countri or our secur to ani other nation i ll never give a veto of american secur to ani other entiti not a nation not a countri not an institut but i know as i think you do that our countri is strongest when we lead the world when we lead strong allianc and that s the way eisenhow and reagan and kennedi and other did it we are not do that today we need to
p4306
aVi have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorist and i will not stop in our effort to hunt down and kill the terrorist but i also have a better plan on how we re go to deal with iraq train the iraqi forc more rapid get our alli back to the tabl with a fresh start with new credibl with a presid whose judgment the rest of the world trust
p4307
aVin addit to that i believ we have a crisi here at home a crisi of the middl class that is increas squeez health care cost go up i have a plan to provid health care to all american i have a plan to provid for our school so we keep the standard but we help our teacher teach and elev our school by fund no child left behind i have a plan to protect the environ so that we leav this place in better shape to our children than we were hand it by our parent that s the test
p4308
aVi believ america s best day are ahead of us i m an optimist but we have to make the right choic to be fiscal respons and to creat the new job of the futur we can do this and i ask you for the privileg of lead our nation to be stronger at home and respect again in the world
p4309
aVthank you
p4310
aVwell let me tell you straight up i ve never chang my mind about iraq i do believ saddam hussein was a threat i alway believ he was a threat believ it in 1998 when clinton was presid i want to give clinton the power to use forc if necessari but i would have use that forc wise i would have use that author wise not rush to war without a plan to win the peac i would have brought our alli to our side i would have fought to make certain our troop had everybodi possibl to help them win the mission
p4311
aVcharli thank thank you all veri much it s been enjoy
p4312
aVthe great contest for the presid is about the futur who can lead who can get thing done we ve been through a lot togeth as a countri been through a recess corpor scandal war and yet think about where we are we ad 1 9 million new job over the past 13 month the farm incom in america is high small busi are flourish homeownership rate is at an alltim high in america we re on the move
p4313
aVtonight i had a chanc to discuss with you what to do to keep this economi go keep the tax low don t increas the scope of the feder govern keep regul down legal reform a health care polici that doe not empow the feder govern but empow individu and an energi plan that will help us becom less depend on foreign sourc of energi
p4314
aVand abroad we re at war and it requir a presid who is steadfast and strong and determin i vow to the american peopl after that fate day of septemb the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we re safe the 9 11 commiss put out a report that said america is safer but not yet safe there s more work to be done we ll stay on the hunt on al qaida we ll deni sanctuari to these terrorist we ll make sure they do not end up with weapon of mass destruct the great nexus the great threat to our countri is that these hater end up with weapon of mass destruct
p4315
aVbut our long term secur depend on our deep faith in liberti we ll continu to promot freedom around the world freedom is on the march tomorrow afghanistan will be vote for a presid in iraq we ll be have free elect and a free societi will make this world more peac
p4316
aVgod bless
p4317
aVthis presid rush to war push our alli asid and iran now is more danger and so is north korea with nuclear weapon he took his eye off the ball off of usama bin laden
p4318
aVare we go to have a rebutt thing back and forth
p4319
aVrememb the last debat my oppon said that america must pass a global test befor we use forc to protect ourselv that s the kind of mindset that say sanction were work that s the kind of mindset that say let s keep it at the unit nation and hope thing go well
p4320
aVsaddam hussein was a threat becaus he could have given weapon of mass destruct to terrorist enemi sanction were not work the unit nation was not effect at remov saddam hussein
p4321
aVthe goal of the sanction was not to remov saddam hussein it was to remov the weapon of mass destruct and mr presid just yesterday the duelfer report told you and the whole world they work he didn t have weapon of mass destruct mr presid that was the object and if we had use smart diplomaci we could have save 200 billion and an invas of iraq and right now usama bin laden might be in jail or dead that s the war against terror
p4322
aVanthoni i would not i have laid out a differ plan becaus the presid s plan is not work you see that everi night on televis there s chao in iraq king abdullah of jordan said just yesterday or the day befor you can t hold elect in iraq with the chao that s go on today senat richard lugar the republican chairman of the foreign relat committe said that the handl of the reconstruct aid in iraq by this administr has been incompet those are the republican chairman s word senat hagel of nebraska said that the handl of iraq is beyond piti beyond embarrass it s in the zone of danger those are the word of two republican respect both on the foreign relat committe
p4323
aVnow i have to tell you i would do someth differ i would reach out to our alli in a way that this presid hasn t he push them away time and again push them away at the u n push them away individu two week ago there was a meet of the north atlant council which is the polit arm of nato they discuss the possibl of a small train unit or have a total takeov of the train in iraq did our administr push for the total train of iraq no were they silent yes was there an effort to bring all the alli togeth around that no becaus they ve alway want this to be an american effort you know they even had the defens depart issu a memorandum say don t bother appli for assist or for be part of the reconstruct if you weren t part of our origin coalit
p4324
aVnow that s not a good way to build support and reduc the risk for our troop and make america safer i m go to get the train done for our troop i m go to get the train of iraqi done faster and i m go to get our alli back to the tabl
p4325
aVtwo day ago in the oval offic i met with the financ minist from iraq he came to see me and he talk about how optimist he was and the countri was about head toward elect think about it they re go from tyranni to elect he talk about the reconstruct effort that are begin to take hold he talk about the fact that iraqi love to be free he said he was optimist when he came here then he turn on the tv and listen to the polit rhetor and all of a sudden he was pessimist
p4326
aVthis is a guy who along with other has taken great risk for freedom and we need to stand with him my oppon say he has a plan sound familiar becaus it s call the bush plan we re go to train troop and we are we ll have 125 000 train by the end of decemb we re spend about 7 billion
p4327
aVhe talk about a grand idea let s have a summit we re go to solv the problem in iraq by hold a summit and what is he go to say to those peopl that show up to the summit join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place risk your troop in a war you ve call a mistak nobodi is go to follow somebodi who doesn t believ we can succeed and somebodi who say the war where we are is a mistak i know how these peopl think i meet with them all the time i talk to toni blair all the time i talk to silvio berlusconi they re not go to follow an american presid who say follow me into a mistak
p4328
aVour plan is work we re go to make elect and iraq is go to be free and america will be better off for it
p4329
aVyes sir pleas
p4330
aVladi and gentlemen the right war was usama bin laden and afghanistan that was the right place and the right time was tora bora when we had him corner in the mountain now everyon in the world know that there were no weapon of mass destruct that was the reason congress gave him the author to use forc not after excus to get rid of the regim
p4331
aVnow we have to succeed i ve alway said that i have been consist yes we have to succeed and i have a better plan to help us do it
p4332
aVfirst of all we didn t find out he didn t have weapon until we got there and my oppon thought he had weapon and told everybodi he thought he had weapon and second it s a fundament misunderstand to say that the war on terror is onli usama bin laden the war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organ do not end up with weapon of mass destruct that s what the war on terror is about
p4333
aVof cours we re go to find usama bin laden we ve alreadi got 75 percent of his peopl and we re on the hunt for him but this is a global conflict that requir firm resolv
p4334
aVyes i certain do
p4335
aVno i appreci that i listen i we ve got a great countri i love our valu and i recogn i ve made some decis that have caus peopl to not understand the great valu of our countri i rememb when ronald reagan was the presid he stood on principl some might have call that stubborn he stood on principl stand up to the soviet union and we won that conflict yet at the same time he was veri we were veri unpopular in europ becaus of decis he made
p4336
aVi recogn that take saddam hussein out was unpopular but i made the decis becaus i thought it was in the right interest of our secur
p4337
aVyou know i ve made some decis on israel that s unpopular i wouldn t deal with arafat becaus i felt like he had let the former presid down and i don t think he s the kind of person that can lead toward a palestinian state and peopl in europ didn t like that decis and that was unpopular but it was the right thing to do i believ palestinian ought to have a state but i know they need leadership that s commit to democraci and freedom leadership that will be will to reject terror
p4338
aVi made a decis not to join the intern crimin court in the hagu which is where our troop could be brought to brought in front of a judg an unaccount judg i don t think we ought to join that that was unpopular and so what i m tell you is is that sometim in this world you make unpopular decis becaus you think they re right
p4339
aVwe ll continu to reach out listen there s 30 nation involv in iraq some 40 nation involv in afghanistan peopl love america sometim they don t like the decis made by america but i don t think you want a presid who tri to becom popular and doe the wrong thing you don t want to join the intern crimin court just becaus it s popular in certain capit in europ
p4340
aVnikki that s a question that s been rais by a lot of peopl around the countri let me address it but also talk about the weapon the presid just talk about becaus everi part of the presid s answer just now promis you more of the same over the next 4 year
p4341
aVthe presid stood right here in this hall 4 year ago and he was ask a question by somebodi just like you under what circumst would you send peopl to war and his answer was with a viabl exit strategi and onli with enough forc to get the job done he didn t do that he broke that promis we didn t have enough forc general shinseki the armi chief of staff told him he was go to need sever hundr thousand and guess what they retir general shinseki for tell him that this presid hasn t listen
p4342
aVi went to meet with the member of the secur council in the week befor we vote i went to new york i talk to all of them to find out how serious they were about realli hold saddam hussein account i came away convinc that if we work at it if we were readi to work at let han blix do his job and thorough go through the inspect that if push came to shove they d be there with us
p4343
aVcheryl the presid didn t find weapon of mass destruct in iraq so he s realli turn his campaign into a weapon of mass decept and the result is that you ve been bombard with advertis suggest that i ve chang a posit on this or that or the other now the three thing they tri to say i ve chang posit on are the patriot act i haven t i support it i just don t like the way john ashcroft has appli it and we re go to chang a few thing the chairman of the republican parti think we ought to chang a few thing
p4344
aVbut the presid just arbitrarili brought the hammer down and said nope sorri time for diplomaci is over we re go he rush to war without a plan to win the peac ladi and gentlemen he gave you a speech and told you he d plan care take everi precaut take our alli with us he didn t he broke his word
p4345
aVi rememb sit in the white hous look at those general say do you have what you need in this war do you have what it take i rememb go down in the basement of the white hous the day we commit our troop as last resort look at tommi frank and the general on the ground ask them do we have the right plan with the right troop level and they look me in the eye and said yes sir mr presid of cours i listen to our general that s what a presid doe a presid set the strategi and reli upon good militari peopl to execut that strategi
p4346
aVyou reli on good militari peopl to execut the militari compon of the strategi but win the peac is larger than just the militari compon general shinseki had the wisdom to say you re go to need sever hundr thousand troop to win the peac the militari s job is to win the war the presid s job is to win the peac the presid did not do what was necessari didn t bring in enough nation didn t deliv the help didn t close off the border didn t even guard the ammo dump and now our kid are be kill with ammo right out of that dump
p4347
aVis it rande i m sorri
p4348
aVi don t think you can just reli on u n sanction rande but you re absolut correct it is a threat it s a huge threat and what s interest is it s a threat that has grown while the presid has been preoccupi with iraq where there wasn t a threat if he d let the inspector do their job and go on we wouldn t have 10 time the number of forc in iraq that we have in afghanistan chase usama bin laden
p4349
aVno child left behind act i vote for it i support it i support the goal but the presid has underfund it by 28 billion right here in st loui you ve laid off 350 teacher you re 150 excus me i think it s a littl more about 100 million shi of what you ought to be under the no child left behind act to help your educ system here so i complain about that i ve argu that we should fulli fund it the presid say i ve chang my mind i haven t chang my mind i m go to fulli fund it so these are the differ
p4350
aVmeanwhil while iran is move toward nuclear weapon some 37 ton of what they call yellow cake the stuff they use to make enrich uranium while they re do that north korea has move from one bomb mayb mayb to 4 to 7 bomb
p4351
aVfor 2 year the presid didn t even engag with north korea did noth at all while it was grow more danger despit the warn of peopl like former secretari of defens william perri who negoti get televis camera and inspector into that reactor we were safer befor presid bush came to offic now they have the bomb and we re less safe
p4352
aVso what do we do we ve got to join with the british and the french with the german who ve been involv in their initi we ve got to lead the world now to crack down on prolifer as a whole but the presid has been slow to do that even in russia at his pace it s go to take 13 year to reduc and get a hold of all the loos nuclear materi in the former soviet union i ve propos a plan that can captur it and contain it and clean it within 4 year
p4353
aVand the presid is move toward the creation of our own bunker bust nuclear weapon it s veri hard to get other countri to give up their weapon when you re busi develop a new one i m go to lead the world in the greatest counterprolifer effort and if we have to get tough with iran believ me we will get tough
p4354
aVthat answer almost made me want to scowl
p4355
aVsecond of cours we ve been involv with iran i fulli understand the threat and that s whi we re do what he suggest we do get the brit the german and the french to go make it veri clear to the iranian that if they expect to be a parti to the world to give up their nuclear ambit we ve been do that
p4356
aVlet me talk about north korea it is naiv and danger to take a polici that he suggest the other day which is to have bilater relat with north korea rememb he is the person who is accus me of not act multilater he now want to take the six parti talk we have china north korea south korea russia japan and the unit state and undermin them by have bilater talk that s what presid clinton did he had bilater talk with the north korean and guess what happen he didn t honor the agreement he was enrich uranium that is a bad polici
p4357
aVof cours we re pay attent to these that s a great question about iran that s whi in my speech to the congress i said there is an axi of evil iraq iran and north korea and we re pay attent to it and we re make progress
p4358
aVnow the presid has presid over the economi where we ve lost 1 6 million job the first presid in 72 year to lose job i have a plan to put peopl back to work that s not wishi washi i m go to close the loophol that actual encourag compani to go oversea the presid want to keep them open i think i m right i think he s wrong
p4359
aVyes great question thank
p4360
aVi hear there s rumor on the internet that we re go to have a draft we re not go to have a draft period the all volunt armi work it work particular when we pay our troop well it work when we make sure they ve got hous like we have done in the last militari budget an all volunt armi is best suit to fight the new war of the 21st centuri which is to be special and to find these peopl as they hide around the world we don t need mass armi anymor
p4361
aVone of the thing we ve done is we ve taken the we re begin to transform our militari and by that i mean we re move troop out of korea and replac them with more effect weapon we don t need as much manpow on the korean peninsula to keep a deterr
p4362
aVin europ we have mass troop as if the soviet union exist and was go to invad into europ but those day are over with and so we re move troop out of europ and replac it with more effect equip
p4363
aVso the answer to your question is we re withdraw not from the world we re draw manpow so they can be station here in america so there s less rotat so life is easier on their famili and therefor more like to be we ll be more like to keep peopl in the all volunt armi
p4364
aVone of the most import thing we re do in this administr is transform there s some realli interest technolog for exampl we re fli unman vehicl that can send real time messag back to station in the unit state that save manpow and it save equip it also mean that we can target thing easier and move more quick which mean we need to be lighter and quicker and more facil and high train
p4365
aVforget all this talk about a draft we re not go to have a draft so long as i m the presid
p4366
aVand no 4 we ve got to make sure that we re help homeown becaus the root problem here has to do with the foreclosur that are take place all across the countri
p4367
aVthe unit state senat will take up a continu resolut tomorrow or the next day sometim next week with 2 000 2 000 look at them my friend look at them you ll be appal
p4368
aVand senat obama is a recent convert after request 932 million worth of pork barrel spend project
p4369
aVso the point is i want peopl to have tax cut i want everi famili to have a 5 000 refund tax credit so they can go out and purchas their own health care i want to doubl the dividend from 3 500 to 7 000 for everi depend child in america
p4370
aVi know that the worst thing we could possibl do is to rais tax on anybodi and a lot of peopl might be interest in senat obama s definit of rich
p4371
aVwell let me just make a coupl of point
p4372
aVmy definit here s what i can tell the american peopl 95 percent of you will get a tax cut and if you make less than 250 000 less than a quarter million dollar a year then you will not see one dime s worth of tax increas
p4373
aVnow john mention the fact that busi tax on paper are high in this countri and he s absolut right here s the problem there are so mani loophol that have been written into the tax code oftentim with support of senat mccain that we actual see our busi pay effect one of the lowest tax rate in the world
p4374
aVand what that mean then is that there are peopl out there who are work everi day who are not get a tax cut and you want to give them more
p4375
aVnow we also have to recogn that this is a final verdict on eight year of fail econom polici promot by georg bush support by senat mccain a theori that basic say that we can shred regul and consum protect and give more and more to the most and somehow prosper will trickl down
p4376
aVit s not like you want to close the loophol you just want to add an addit tax cut over the loophol and that s a problem
p4377
aVjust one last point i want to make sinc senat mccain talk about provid a 5 000 health credit now what he doesn t tell you is that he intend to for the first time in histori tax health benefit
p4378
aVso you may end up get a 5 000 tax credit here s the onli problem your employ now has to pay tax on the health care that you re get from your employ and if you end up lose your health care from your employ you ve got to go out on the open market and tri to buy it
p4379
aVit is not a good deal for the american peopl but it s an exampl of this notion that the market can alway solv everyth and that the less regul we have the better off we re go to be
p4380
aVwell you know let me just
p4381
aVi know we have to but this is a classic exampl of walk the walk and talk the talk
p4382
aVwe had an energi bill befor the unit state senat it was festoon with
p4383
aVchristma tree ornament it had all kind of break for the oil compani i mean billion of dollar worth i vote against it senat obama vote for it
p4384
aVjohn you want to give oil compani anoth 4 billion
p4385
aVit hasn t work and i think that the fundament of the economi have to be measur by whether or not the middl class is get a fair shake that s whi i m run for presid and that s what i hope we re go to be talk about tonight
p4386
aVyou ve got to look at our record you ve got to look at our record that s the import thing
p4387
aVwho fought against wast and earmark spend who has been the person who has tri to keep spend under control
p4388
aVwho s the person who has believ that the best thing for america is is to have a tax system that is fundament fair and i ve fought to simplifi it and i have propos to simplifi it
p4389
aVlet s give everi american a choic two tax bracket generous dividend and two and let american choos whether they want the the exist tax code or they want a new tax code
p4390
aVand so again look at the record particular the energi bill but again senat obama has shift on a number of occas he has vote in the unit state senat to increas tax on peopl who make as low as 42 000 a year
p4391
aVthat s not true john that s not true
p4392
aVand that s just a fact again you can look it up
p4393
aVlook it s just not true and if we want to talk about oil compani profit under your tax plan john this is undeni oil compani would get an addit 4 billion in tax break
p4394
aVnow look we all would love to lower tax on everybodi but here s the problem if we are give them to oil compani then that mean that there are those who are not go to be get them and
p4395
aVwith all due respect you alreadi gave them to the oil compani
p4396
aVno but john the fact of the matter is is that i was oppos to those tax break tri to strip them out we ve got an emerg bill on the senat floor right now that contain some good stuff some stuff you want includ drill off shore but you re oppos to it becaus it would strip away those tax break that have gone to oil compani
p4397
aVwell there are a rang of thing that are probabl go to have to be delay we don t yet know what our tax revenu are go to be the economi is slow down so it s hard to anticip right now what the budget is go to look like next year
p4398
aVbut there s no doubt that we re not go to be abl to do everyth that i think need to be done there are some thing that i think have to be done
p4399
aVwe have to have energi independ so i ve put forward a plan to make sure that in 10 year time we have freed ourselv from depend on middl eastern oil by increas product at home but most import by start to invest in altern energi solar wind biodiesel make sure that we re develop the fuel effici car of the futur right here in the unit state in ohio and michigan instead of japan and south korea
p4400
aVwe have to fix our health care system which is put an enorm burden on famili just a report just came out that the averag deduct went up 30 percent on american famili
p4401
aVthey are get crush and mani of them are go bankrupt as a consequ of health care i m meet folk all over the countri we have to do that now becaus it will actual make our busi and our famili better off
p4402
aVthe third thing we have to do is we ve got to make sure that we re compet in educ we ve got to invest in scienc and technolog china had a space launch and a space walk we ve got to make sure that our children are keep pace in math and in scienc
p4403
aVand one of the thing i think we have to do is make sure that colleg is afford for everi young person in america
p4404
aVwell thank you jim and thank to everybodi
p4405
aVand i also think that we re go to have to rebuild our infrastructur which is fall behind our road our bridg but also broadband line that reach into rural communiti
p4406
aValso make sure that we have a new electr grid to get the altern energi to popul center that are use them
p4407
aVso there are some some thing that we ve got to do structur to make sure that we can compet in this global economi we can t shortchang those thing we ve got to elimin program that don t work and we ve got to make sure that the program that we do have are more effici and cost less
p4408
aVlook we no matter what we ve got to cut spend we have as i said we ve let govern get complet out of control
p4409
aVsenat obama has the most liber vote record in the unit state senat it s hard to reach across the aisl from that far to the left
p4410
aVthe point the point is the point is we need to examin everi agenc of govern
p4411
aVfirst of all by the way i d elimin ethanol subsidi i oppos ethanol subsidi
p4412
aVi think that we have to return particular in defens spend which is the largest part of our appropri we have to do away with cost plus contract we now have defens system that the cost are complet out of control
p4413
aVwe tri to build a littl ship call the littor combat ship that was suppos to cost 140 million end up cost 400 million and we still haven t done it
p4414
aVand i do have a sad note tonight senat kennedi is in the hospit he s a dear and belov friend to all of us our thought and prayer go out to the lion of the senat
p4415
aVso we need to have fix cost contract we need veri bad to understand that defens spend is veri import and vital particular in the new challeng we face in the world but we have to get a lot of the cost overrun under control
p4416
aVi know how to do that
p4417
aVi save the taxpay 6 8 billion by fight a contract that was negoti between boe and dod that was complet wrong and we fix it and we kill it and the peopl end up in feder prison so i know how to do this becaus i ve been involv these issu for mani mani year but i think that we have to examin everi agenc of govern and find out those that are do their job and keep them and find out those that aren t and elimin them and we ll have to scrub everi agenc of govern
p4418
aVno as i said befor jim there are go to be thing that end up have to be
p4419
aVdefer and delay well look i want to make sure that we are invest in energi in order to free ourselv from the depend on foreign oil that is a big project that is a multi year project
p4420
aVnot will to give up the need to do it but there may be individu compon that we can t do but john is right we have to make cut we right now give 15 billion everi year as subsidi to privat insur under the medicar system doesn t work ani better through the privat insur they just skim off 15 billion that was a give away and part of the reason is becaus lobbyist are abl to shape how medicar work
p4421
aVthey did it on the medicaid prescript drug bill and we have to chang the cultur tom or john mention me be wild liber most that s just me oppos georg bush s wrong head polici sinc i ve been in congress but i think it is that it is also import to recogn i work with tom coburn the most conserv one of the most conserv republican who john alreadi mention to set up what we call a googl for govern say we ll list everi dollar of feder spend to make sure that the taxpay can take a look and see who in fact is promot some of these spend project that john s been rail about
p4422
aVi also want to thank the univers of mississippi for host us tonight
p4423
aVhow about a spend freez on everyth but defens veteran affair and entitl program
p4424
aVi think we ought to serious consid with the except the care of veteran nation defens and sever other vital issu
p4425
aVthe problem with a spend freez is you re use a hatchet where you need a scalpel there are some program that are veri import that are under fund i went to increas earli childhood educ and the notion that we should freez that when there may be for exampl this medicar subsidi doesn t make sens
p4426
aVlet me tell you anoth place to look for some save we are current spend 10 billion a month in iraq when they have a 79 billion surplus it seem to me that if we re go to be strong at home as well as strong abroad that we have to look at bring that war to a close
p4427
aVlook we are send 700 billion a year oversea to countri that don t like us veri much some of that money end up in the hand of terrorist organ we have to have wind tide solar natur gas flex fuel car and all that but we also have to have offshor drill and we also have to have nuclear power
p4428
aVsenat obama oppos both store and reprocess of spent nuclear fuel you can t get there from here and the fact is that we can creat 700 000 job by build construct 45 new nuclear power plant by the year 2030 nuclear power is not onli import as far as elimin our depend on foreign oil but it s also respons as far as climat chang is concern and the issu i have been involv in for mani mani year and i m proud of the work of the work that i ve done there along with presid clinton
p4429
aVand jim i i ve been not feel too great about a lot of thing late so have a lot of american who are face challeng but i m feel a littl better tonight and i ll tell you whi
p4430
aVthere s no doubt it will affect our budget there is no doubt about it not onli even if we get all 700 billion back let s assum the market recov we hold asset long enough that eventu taxpay get it back and that happen dure the great depress when roosevelt purchas a whole bunch of home over time home valu went back up and in fact govern made a profit if we re lucki and do it right that could potenti happen but in the short term there s an outlay and we may not see that money for a while
p4431
aVand becaus of the economi s slow down i think we can also expect less tax revenu so there s no doubt that as presid i m go do have to make some tough decis
p4432
aVthe onli point i want to make is this that in order to make the tough decis we have to know what our valu are and who we re fight for and our prioriti and if we are spend 300 billion on tax cut for peopl who don t need them and weren t even ask for them and we are leav out health care which is crush on peopl all across the countri then i think we have made a bad decis and i want to make sure we re not shortchang our long term prioriti
p4433
aVwell i want to make sure we re not hand the health care system over to the feder govern which is basic what would ultim happen with senat obama s health care plan i want the famili to make decis between themselv and their doctor not the feder govern look we have to obvious cut spend i have fought to cut spend senat obama has 800 billion in new spend program i would suggest he start by cancel some of those new spend program that he has
p4434
aVwe can t i think adjust spend around to take care of the veri much need program includ take care of our veteran but i also want to say again a healthi economi with low tax would not rais anyon s tax is probabl the best recip for eventu have our economi recov
p4435
aVand spend restraint has got to be a vital part of that and the reason one of the major reason whi we re in the difficulti we are in today is becaus spend got out of control we owe china 500 billion and spend i know can be brought under control becaus i have fought against excess spend my entir career and i got plan to reduc and elimin unnecessari and wast spend and if there s anybodi here who think there aren t agenc of govern where spend can be cut and their budget slash they have not spent a lot of time in washington
p4436
aVi just want to make this point jim john it s been your presid who you said you agre with 90 percent of the time who presid over this increas in spend this orgi of spend and enorm deficit you vote for almost all of his budget so to stand here and after eight year and say that you re go to lead on control spend and you know balanc our tax cut so that they help middl class famili when over the last eight year that hasn t happen i think just is you know kind of hard to swallow
p4437
aVit s well known that i have not been elect miss congeni in the unit state senat nor with the administr i have oppos the presid on spend on climat chang on tortur of prison on on guantanamo bay on a on the way that the iraq war was conduct i have a long record and the american peopl know me veri well and that is independ and a maverick of the senat and i m happi to say that i ve got a partner that s a good maverick along with me now
p4438
aVbecaus as we re here tonight in this debat we are see for the first time in a long time republican and democrat togeth sit down tri to work out a solut to this fiscal crisi that we re in
p4439
aVi think the lesson of iraq are veri clear that you cannot have a fail strategi that will then caus you to near lose a conflict our initi militari success we went in to baghdad and everybodi celebr and then the war was veri bad mishandl i went to iraq in 2003 and came back and said we ve got to chang this strategi this strategi requir addit troop it requir a fundament chang in strategi and i fought for it and final we came up with a great general and a strategi that has succeed
p4440
aVthis strategi has succeed and we are win in iraq and we will come home with victori and with honor and that withdraw is the result of everi counterinsurg that succeed
p4441
aVthe consequ of defeat would have been increas iranian influenc it would have been increas in sectarian violenc it would have been a wider war which
p4442
aVthe unit state of america might have had to come back
p4443
aVso there was a lot at stake there and thank to this great general david petraeus and the troop who serv under him they have succeed and we are win in iraq and we will come home and we will come home as we have when we have won other war and not in defeat
p4444
aVwell this is an area where senat mccain and i have a fundament differ becaus i think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place
p4445
aVnow six year ago i stood up and oppos this war at a time when it was polit riski to do so becaus i said that not onli did we not know how much it was go to cost what our exit strategi might be how it would affect our relationship around the world and whether our intellig was sound but also becaus we hadn t finish the job in afghanistan
p4446
aVwe hadn t caught bin laden we hadn t put al qaeda to rest and as a consequ i thought that it was go to be a distract now senat mccain and presid bush had a veri differ judgment
p4447
aVand i wish i had been wrong for the sake of the countri and they had been right but that s not the case we ve spent over 600 billion so far soon to be 1 trillion we have lost over 4 000 live we have seen 30 000 wound and most import from a strateg nation secur perspect al qaeda is resurg stronger now than at ani time sinc 2001
p4448
aVand have no doubt about the magnitud of this crisi and we re not talk about failur of institut on wall street we re talk about failur on main street and peopl who will lose their job and their credit and their home if we don t fix the greatest fiscal crisi probabl in certain in our time and i ve been around a littl while
p4449
aVwe took our eye off the ball and not to mention that we are still spend 10 billion a month when they have a 79 billion surplus at a time when we are in great distress here at home and we just talk about the fact that our budget is way overstretch and we are borrow money from oversea to tri to financ just some of the basic function of our govern
p4450
aVso i think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesit to use militari forc and i will not as presid in order to keep the american peopl safe but we have to use our militari wise and we did not use our militari wise in iraq
p4451
aVthe next presid of the unit state is not go to have to address the issu as to whether we went into iraq or not the next presid of the unit state is go to have to decid how we leav when we leav and what we leav behind that s the decis of the next presid of the unit state
p4452
aVsenat obama said the surg could not work said it would increas sectarian violenc said it was doom to failur recent on a televis program he said it exceed our wildest expect
p4453
aVbut yet after conced that he still say that he would oppos the surg if he had to decid that again today incred incred senat obama didn t go to iraq for 900 day and never
p4454
aVsenat obama is the chairperson of a committe that oversight nato that s in afghanistan to this day he has never had a hear
p4455
aVi mean it s remark
p4456
aVwell thank you veri much jim and thank to the commiss and the univers of mississippi ole miss for host us tonight i can t think of a more import time for us to talk about the futur of the countri
p4457
aVbut the point is the point is we have final seen republican and democrat sit down and negoti togeth and come up with a packag
p4458
aVwhich point he rais a whole bunch of them
p4459
aVlook i m veri proud of my vice presidenti select joe biden who is the chairman of the senat foreign relat committe and as he explain and as john well know the issu of afghanistan the issu of iraq critic issu like that don t go through my subcommitte becaus they re done as a committe as a whole
p4460
aVbut that s senat insid basebal but let s get back to the core issu here senat mccain is absolut right that the violenc has been reduc as a consequ of the extraordinari sacrific of our troop and our militari famili
p4461
aVthey have done a brilliant job and general petraeus has done a brilliant job but understand that was a tactic design to contain the damag of the previous four year of mismanag of this war
p4462
aVand so john like john you like to pretend like the war start in 2007 you talk about the surg the war start in 2003 and at the time when the war start you said it was go to be quick and easi you said we knew where the weapon of mass destruct were you were wrong
p4463
aVyou said that we were go to be greet as liber you were wrong you said that there was no histori of violenc between shiit and sunni and you were wrong and so my question is
p4464
aVof judgment of whether or not of whether or not if the question is who is best equip as the next presid to make good decis about how we use our militari how we make sure that we are prepar and readi for the next conflict then i think we can take a look at our judgment
p4465
aVthis packag has transpar in it it has to have account and oversight it has to have option for loan to fail busi rather than the govern take over those loan we have to it has to have a packag with a number of other essenti element to it
p4466
aVi m afraid senat obama doesn t understand the differ between a tactic and a strategi but the import i d like to tell you two fourth of juli ago i was in baghdad general petraeus invit senat lindsey graham and me to attend a ceremoni where 688 brave young american whose enlist had expir were reenlist to stay and fight for iraqi freedom and american freedom
p4467
aVi was honor to be there i was honor to speak to those troop and you know afterward we spent a lot of time with them and you know what they said to us they said let us win they said let us win we don t want our kid come back here
p4468
aVand this strategi and this general they are win senat obama refus to acknowledg that we are win in iraq
p4469
aVthat s not true
p4470
aVthey just pass an elector
p4471
aVthat s not true
p4472
aVan elect law just in the last few day there is social econom progress and a strategi a strategi of go into an area clear and hold and the peopl of the countri then becom alli with you they inform on the bad guy and peac come to the countri and prosper
p4473
aVthat s what s happen in iraq and it wasn t a tactic
p4474
aVand yes i went back to washington and i met with my republican in the hous of repres and they weren t part of the negoti and i understand that and it was the hous republican that decid that they would be part of the solut to this problem
p4475
aVjim jim this is a big
p4476
aVit was a stratagem and that same strategi will be employ in afghanistan by this great general and senat obama who after promis not to vote to cut off fund for the troop did the incred thing of vote to cut off the fund for the troop in iraq and afghanistan
p4477
aVjim there are a whole bunch of thing we have got to answer first of all let s talk about this troop fund issu becaus john alway bring this up senat mccain cut senat mccain oppos fund for troop in legisl that had a timet becaus he didn t believ in a timet
p4478
aVi oppos fund a mission that had no timet and was open end give a blank check to georg bush we had a differ on the timet we didn t have a differ on whether or not we were go to be fund troop
p4479
aVwe had a legitim differ and i absolut understand the differ between tactic and strategi and the strateg question that the presid has to ask is not whether or not we are employ a particular approach in the countri onc we have made the decis to be there
p4480
aVthe question is was this wise we have seen afghanistan worsen deterior we need more troop there we need more resourc there senat mccain in the rush to go into iraq said you know what we ve been success in afghanistan there is nobodi who can pose a threat to us there
p4481
aVthis is a time when bin laden was still out and now they ve reconstitut themselv secretari of defens robert gate himself acknowledg the war on terror start in afghanistan and it need to end there
p4482
aVbut we can t do it if we are not will to give iraq back it countri now what i ve said is we should end this war respons we should do it in phase but in 16 month we should be abl to reduc our combat troop put provid some relief to militari famili and our troop and bolster our effort in afghanistan so that we can captur and kill bin laden and crush al qaeda
p4483
aVand right now the command in afghanistan as well as admir mullen have acknowledg that we don t have enough troop to deal with afghanistan becaus we still have more troop in iraq than we did befor the surg
p4484
aVadmir mullen suggest that senat obama s plan is danger for america
p4485
aVbut i want to emphas one point to all american tonight this isn t the begin of the end of this crisi this is the end of the begin if we come out with a packag that will keep these institut stabl
p4486
aVthat s not the case
p4487
aVthat s what
p4488
aVwhat he said was a precipit
p4489
aVthat s what admir mullen said
p4490
aVwithdraw would be danger he did not say that that s not true
p4491
aVand also general petraeus said the same thing osama bin laden and general petraeus have one thing in common that i know of they both said that iraq is the central battleground
p4492
aVnow general petraeus has prais the success but he said those success are fragil and if we set a specif date for withdraw and by the way senat obama s origin plan they would have been out last spring befor the surg ever had a chanc to succeed
p4493
aVand i m i m understand whi senat obama was surpris and said that the surg succeed beyond his wildest expect
p4494
aVit didn t exceed beyond mine becaus i know that that s a strategi that has work and can succeed but if we snatch defeat from the jaw of victori and adopt senat obama s plan then we will have a wider war and it will make thing more complic throughout the region includ in afghanistan
p4495
aVand we ve got a lot of work to do and we ve got to creat job and one of the area of cours is to elimin our depend on foreign oil
p4496
aVyes i think we need more troop i ve been say that for over a year now
p4497
aVand i think that we have to do it as quick as possibl becaus it s been acknowledg by the command on the ground the situat is get wors not better
p4498
aVwe had the highest fatal among u s troop this past year than at ani time sinc 2002 and we are see a major offens take place al qaeda and taliban cross the border and attack our troop in a brazen fashion they are feel embolden
p4499
aVand we cannot separ afghanistan from iraq becaus what our command have said is we don t have the troop right now to deal with afghanistan
p4500
aVso i would send two to three addit brigad to afghanistan now keep in mind that we have four time the number of troop in iraq where nobodi had anyth to do with 9 11 befor we went in where in fact there was no al qaeda befor we went in but we have four time more troop there than we do in afghanistan
p4501
aVand that is a strateg mistak becaus everi intellig agenc will acknowledg that al qaeda is the greatest threat against the unit state and that secretari of defens gate acknowledg the central front that the place where we have to deal with these folk is go to be in afghanistan and in pakistan
p4502
aVso here s what we have to do comprehens though it s not just more troop
p4503
aVwe have to press the afghan govern to make certain that they are actual work for their peopl and i ve said this to presid karzai
p4504
aVno 2 we ve got to deal with a grow poppi trade that has explod over the last sever year
p4505
aVno 3 we ve got to deal with pakistan becaus al qaeda and the taliban have safe haven in pakistan across the border in the northwest region and although you know under georg bush with the support of senat mccain we ve been give them 10 billion over the last seven year they have not done what need to be done to get rid of those safe haven
p4506
aVand until we do american here at home are not go to be safe
p4507
aVfirst of all i won t repeat the mistak that i regret enorm and that is after we were abl to help the afghan freedom fighter and drive the russian out of afghanistan we basic wash our hand of the region
p4508
aVand the result over time was the taliban al qaeda and a lot of the difficulti we are face today so we can t ignor those lesson of histori
p4509
aVnow on this issu of aid pakistan if you re go to aim a gun at somebodi georg shultz our great secretari of state told me onc you d better be prepar to pull the trigger
p4510
aVi m not prepar at this time to cut off aid to pakistan so i m not prepar to threaten it as senat obama appar want to do as he has said that he would announc militari strike into pakistan
p4511
aVwe ve got to get the support of the peopl of of pakistan he said that he would launch militari strike into pakistan
p4512
aVnow you don t do that you don t say that out loud if you have to do thing you have to do thing and you work with the pakistani govern
p4513
aVnow the new presid of pakistan kardari sic has got his hand full and this area on the border has not been govern sinc the day of alexand the great
p4514
aVi ve been to waziristan i can see how tough that terrain is it s rule by a hand of tribe
p4515
aVand yes senat obama call for more troop but what he doesn t understand it s got to be a new strategi the same strategi that he condemn in iraq it s go to have to be employ in afghanistan
p4516
aVand we re go to have to help the pakistani go into these area and obtain the allegi of the peopl and it s go to be tough they ve intermarri with al qaeda and the taliban and it s go to be tough but we have to get the cooper of the peopl in those area
p4517
aVand the pakistani are go to have to understand that that bomb in the marriott hotel in islamabad was a signal from the terrorist that they don t want that govern to cooper with us in combat the taliban and jihadist element
p4518
aVso we ve got a lot of work to do in afghanistan but i m confid now that general petraeus is in the new posit of command that we will employ a strategi which not onli mean addit troop and by the way there have been 20 000 addit troop from 32 000 to 53 000 and there need to be more
p4519
aVso it s not just the addit of troop that matter it s a strategi that will succeed and pakistan is a veri import element in this and i know how to work with him and i guarante you i would not public state that i m go to attack them
p4520
aVnobodi talk about attack pakistan here s what i said
p4521
aVand if john want to disagre with this he can let me know that if the unit state has al qaeda bin laden top level lieuten in our sight and pakistan is unabl or unwil to act then we should take them out
p4522
aVnow i think that s the right strategi i think that s the right polici
p4523
aVand john i you re absolut right that presid have to be prudent in what they say but you know come from you who you know in the past has threaten extinct for north korea and you know sung song about bomb iran i don t know you know how credibl that is i think this is the right strategi
p4524
aVwe haven t seen the languag yet and i do think that there s construct work be done out there so for the viewer who are watch i am optimist about the capac of us to come togeth with a plan
p4525
aVnow senat mccain is also right that it s difficult this is not an easi situat you ve got cross border attack against u s troop
p4526
aVand we ve got a choic we could allow our troop to just be on the defens and absorb those blow again and again and again if pakistan is unwil to cooper or we have to start make some decis
p4527
aVand the problem john with the strategi that s been pursu was that for 10 year we coddl musharraf we alien the pakistani popul becaus we were anti democrat we had a 20th centuri mindset that basic said well you know he may be a dictat but he s our dictat
p4528
aVand as a consequ we lost legitimaci in pakistan we spent 10 billion and in the meantim they weren t go after al qaeda and they are more power now than at ani time sinc we began the war in afghanistan
p4529
aVthat s go to chang when i m presid of the unit state
p4530
aVi i don t think that senat obama understand that there was a fail state in pakistan when musharraf came to power everybodi who was around then and had been there and knew about it knew that it was a fail state
p4531
aVbut let me tell you you know this busi about bomb iran and all that let me tell you my record
p4532
aVback in 1983 when i was a brand new unit state congressman the one the person i admir the most and still admir the most ronald reagan want to send marin into lebanon
p4533
aVand i saw that and i saw the situat and i stood up and i vote against that becaus i was afraid that they couldn t make peac in a place where 300 or 400 or sever hundr marin would make a differ tragic i was right near 300 marin lost their live in the bomb of the barrack
p4534
aVand then we had somalia then we had the first gulf war i support i support that
p4535
aVthe question i think that we have to ask ourselv is how did we get into this situat in the first place
p4536
aVi support us go into bosnia when a number of my own parti and colleagu was against that oper in bosnia that was the right thing to do to stop genocid and to preserv what was necessari insid of europ
p4537
aVi support what we did in kosovo i support it becaus ethnic cleans and genocid was take place there
p4538
aVand i have a record and somalia i oppos that we should turn turn the forc in somalia from a peacekeep forc into a peacemak forc which they were not capabl of
p4539
aVso i have a record i have a record of be involv in these nation secur issu which involv the highest respons and the toughest decis that ani presid can make and that is to send our young men and women into harm s way
p4540
aVand i ll tell you i had a town hall meet in wolfeboro new hampshir and a woman stood up and she said senat mccain i want you to do me the honor of wear a bracelet with my son s name on it
p4541
aVhe was 22 year old and he was kill in combat outsid of baghdad matthew stanley befor christma last year this was last august a year ago and i said i will i will wear his bracelet with honor
p4542
aVand this was august a year ago and then she said but senat mccain i want you to do everyth promis me one thing that you ll do everyth in your power to make sure that my son s death was not in vain
p4543
aVthat mean that that mission succeed just like those young peopl who re enlist in baghdad just like the mother i met at the airport the other day whose son was kill and they all say to me that we don t want defeat
p4544
aVjim let me just make a point i ve got a bracelet too from sergeant from the mother of sergeant ryan david jopeck sure anoth mother is not go through what i m go through
p4545
aVno u s soldier ever die in vain becaus they re carri out the mission of their command in chief and we honor all the servic that they ve provid our troop have perform brilliant the question is for the next presid are we make good judgment about how to keep america safe precis becaus send our militari into battl is such an enorm step
p4546
aVtwo year ago i warn that becaus of the subprim lend mess becaus of the lax regul that we were potenti go to have a problem and tri to stop some of the abus in mortgag that were take place at the time
p4547
aVand the point that i origin made is that we took our eye off afghanistan we took our eye off the folk who perpetr 9 11 they are still send out videotap and senat mccain nobodi is talk about defeat in iraq but i have to say we are have enorm problem in afghanistan becaus of that decis
p4548
aVand it is not true you have consist been concern about what happen in afghanistan at one point while you were focus on iraq you said well we can muddl through afghanistan you don t muddl through the central front on terror and you don t muddl through go after bin laden you don t muddl through stamp out the taliban
p4549
aVi think that is someth we have to take serious and when i m presid i will
p4550
aVyou might think that with that kind of concern that senat obama would have gone to afghanistan particular given his respons as a subcommitte chairman by the way when i m subcommitte chairman we take up the issu under my subcommitte but the import thing is the import thing is i visit afghanistan and i travel to waziristan and i travel to these place and i know what our secur requir are i know what our need are so the point is that we will prevail in afghanistan but we need the new strategi and we need it to succeed
p4551
aVbut the import thing is if we suffer defeat in iraq which general petraeus predict we will if we adopt senat obama s set date for withdraw then that will have a calamit effect in afghanistan and american nation secur interest in the region senat obama doesn t seem to understand there is a connect between the two
p4552
aVa testimoni to you jim
p4553
aVyou know we are at a defin moment in our histori our nation is involv in two war and we are go through the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress
p4554
aVlast year i wrote to the secretari of the treasuri to make sure that he understood the magnitud of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakehold togeth to tri to deal with it
p4555
aVmy read of the threat from iran is that if iran acquir nuclear weapon it is an existenti threat to the state of israel and to other countri in the region becaus the other countri in the region will feel compel requir to acquir nuclear weapon as well
p4556
aVnow we cannot a second holocaust let s just make that veri clear what i have propos for a long time and i ve had convers with foreign leader about form a leagu of democraci let s be clear and let s have some straight talk the russian are prevent signific action in the unit nation secur council
p4557
aVi have propos a leagu of democraci a group of peopl a group of countri that share common interest common valu common ideal they also control a lot of the world s econom power we could impos signific meaning pain sanction on the iranian that i think could have a benefici effect
p4558
aVthe iranian have a lousi govern so therefor their economi is lousi even though they have signific oil revenu so i am convinc that togeth we can with the french with the british with the german and other countri democraci around the world we can affect iranian behavior
p4559
aVbut have no doubt but have no doubt that the iranian continu on the path to the acquisit of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight and it is a threat not onli in this region but around the world
p4560
aVwhat i d also like to point out the iranian are put the most lethal i into iraq which are kill young american there are special group in iran come into iraq and are be train in iran there is the republican guard in iran which senat kyl had an amend in order to declar them a sponsor of terror senat obama said that would be provoc
p4561
aVso this is a serious threat this is a serious threat to secur in the world and i believ we can act and we can act with our friend and alli and reduc that threat as quick as possibl but have no doubt about the ultim result of them acquir nuclear weapon
p4562
aVwell let me just correct someth veri quick i believ the republican guard of iran is a terrorist organ i ve consist said so what senat mccain refer to is a measur in the senat that would tri to broaden the mandat insid of iraq to deal with iran
p4563
aVand iron the singl thing that has strengthen iran over the last sever year has been the war in iraq iraq was iran s mortal enemi that was clear away and what we ve seen over the last sever year is iran s influenc grow they have fund hezbollah they have fund hama they have gone from zero centrifug to 4 000 centrifug to develop a nuclear weapon
p4564
aVso so the question i think that we ve got to ask ourselv is yes we ve got to solv this problem short term and we are go to have to interven there s no doubt about that
p4565
aVso obvious our polici over the last eight year has not work senat mccain is absolut right we cannot toler a nuclear iran it would be a game changer not onli would it threaten israel a countri that is our stalwart alli but it would also creat an environ in which you could set off an arm race in this middl east
p4566
aVnow here s what we need to do we do need tougher sanction i do not agre with senat mccain that we re go to be abl to execut the kind of sanction we need without some cooper with some countri like russia and china that are i think senat mccain would agre not democraci but have extens trade with iran but potenti have an interest in make sure iran doesn t have a nuclear weapon
p4567
aVbut we are also go to have to i believ engag in tough direct diplomaci with iran and this is a major differ i have with senat mccain this notion by not talk to peopl we are punish them has not work it has not work in iran it has not work in north korea in each instanc our effort of isol have actual acceler their effort to get nuclear weapon that will chang when i m presid of the unit state
p4568
aVsenat obama twice said in debat he would sit down with ahmadinejad chavez and raul castro without precondit without precondit here is ahmadinenen mispronunci ahmadinejad who is ahmadinejad who is now in new york talk about the extermin of the state of israel of wipe israel off the map and we re go to sit down without precondit across the tabl to legitim and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espous the extermin of the state of israel and therefor then give them more credenc in the world arena and therefor say they ve probabl been do the right thing becaus you will sit down across the tabl from them and that will legitim their illeg behavior
p4569
aVthe point is that throughout histori whether it be ronald reagan who wouldn t sit down with brezhnev andropov or chernenko until gorbachev was readi with glasnost and perestroika
p4570
aVor whether it be nixon s trip to china which was preced by henri kissing mani time befor he went look i ll sit down with anybodi but there s got to be pre condit those pre condit would appli that we wouldn t legitim with a face to face meet a person like ahmadinejad now senat obama said without precondit
p4571
aVso let s talk about this first of all ahmadinejad is not the most power person in iran so he may not be the right person to talk to but i reserv the right as presid of the unit state to meet with anybodi at a time and place of my choos if i think it s go to keep america safe
p4572
aVand i m glad that senat mccain brought up the histori the bipartisan histori of us engag in direct diplomaci
p4573
aVsenat mccain mention henri kissing who s one of his advis who along with five recent secretari of state just said that we should meet with iran guess what without precondit this is one of your own advis
p4574
aVbut we re also go to have to look at how is it that we shred so mani regul we did not set up a 21st centuri regulatori framework to deal with these problem and that in part has to do with an econom philosophi that say that regul is alway bad
p4575
aVnow understand what this mean without precondit it doesn t mean that you invit them over for tea one day what it mean is that we don t do what we ve been do which is to say until you agre to do exact what we say we won t have direct contact with you
p4576
aVthere s a differ between precondit and prepar of cours we ve got to do prepar start with low level diplomat talk and it may not work becaus iran is a rogu regim
p4577
aVbut i will point out that i was call naiv when i suggest that we need to look at explor contact with iran and you know what presid bush recent sent a senior ambassador bill burn to particip in talk with the european around the issu of nuclear weapon
p4578
aVagain it may not work but if it doesn t work then we have strengthen our abil to form allianc to impos the tough sanction that senat mccain just mention
p4579
aVand when we haven t done it as in north korea let me just take one more exampl in north korea we cut off talk they re a member of the axi of evil we can t deal with them
p4580
aVand you know what happen they went they quadrupl their nuclear capac they test a nuke they test missil they pull out of the nonprolifer agreement and they sent nuclear secret potenti to countri like syria
p4581
aVwhen we re engag becaus again the bush administr revers cours on this then we have at least made some progress although right now becaus of the problem in north korea we are see it on shaki ground
p4582
aVand and i just so i just have to make this general point that the bush administr some of senat mccain s own advis all think this is import and senat mccain appear resist
p4583
aVhe even said the other day that he would not meet potenti with the prime minist of spain becaus he you know he wasn t sure whether they were align with us i mean spain spain is a nato alli
p4584
aVof cours
p4585
aVif we can t meet with our friend i don t know how we re go to lead the world in term of deal with critic issu like terror
p4586
aVi m not go to set the white hous visitor schedul befor i m presid of the unit state i don t even have a seal yet
p4587
aVlook dr kissing did not say that he would approv of face to face meet between the presid of the unit state and the presid and ahmadinejad he did not say that
p4588
aVof cours not
p4589
aVhe said that there could be secretari level and lower level meet i ve alway encourag them the iranian have met with ambassador crocker in baghdad
p4590
aVwhat senat obama doesn t seem to understand that if without precondit you sit down across the tabl from someon who has call israel a stink corps and want to destroy that countri and wipe it off the map you legitim those comment
p4591
aVthis is danger it isn t just naiv it s danger and so we just have a fundament differ of opinion
p4592
aVas far as north korea is concern our secretari of state madelein albright went to north korea by the way north korea most repress and brutal regim probabl on earth the averag south korean is three inch taller than the averag north korean a huge gulag
p4593
aVwe don t know what the status of the dear leader s health is today but we know this that the north korean have broken everi agreement that they ve enter into
p4594
aVand we ought to go back to a littl bit of ronald reagan s trust but verifi and certain not sit down across the tabl from without precondit as senat obama said he did twice i mean it s just danger
p4595
aVi i hope so and i
p4596
aVlook i mean senat mccain keep on use this exampl that sudden the presid would just meet with somebodi without do ani prepar without have low level talk nobodi s been talk about that and senat mccain know it this is a mischaracter of my posit
p4597
aVwhen we talk about precondit and henri kissing did say we should have contact without precondit the idea is that we do not expect to solv everi problem befor we initi talk
p4598
aVand you know the bush administr has come to recogn that it hasn t work this notion that we are simpli silent when it come to our enemi and the notion that we would sit with ahmadinejad and not say anyth while he s spew his nonsens and his vile comment is ridicul nobodi is even talk about that
p4599
aVso let me get this right we sit down with ahmadinejad and he say we re go to wipe israel off the face of the earth and we say no you re not oh pleas
p4600
aVno let me tell
p4601
aVby the way my friend dr kissing who s been my friend for 35 year would be interest to hear this convers and senat obama s depict of his of his posit on the issu i ve known him for 35 year
p4602
aVwe will take a look
p4603
aVand i guarante you he would not he would not say that presidenti top level
p4604
aVnobodi s talk about that
p4605
aVof cours he encourag and other peopl encourag contact and negoti and all other thing we do that all the time
p4606
aVand senat obama is pars word when he say precondit mean prepar
p4607
aVi am not pars word
p4608
aVhe s pars word my friend
p4609
aVi m use the same word that your advis use
p4610
aVpleas go ahead
p4611
aVwell i think that given what s happen over the last sever week and month our entir russian approach has to be evalu becaus a resurg and veri aggress russia is a threat to the peac and stabil of the region
p4612
aVtheir action in georgia were unaccept they were unwarr and at this point it is absolut critic for the next presid to make clear that we have to follow through on our six parti or the six point ceas fire they have to remov themselv from south ossetia and abkhazia
p4613
aVsure
p4614
aVit is absolut import that we have a unifi allianc and that we explain to the russian that you cannot be a 21st centuri superpow or power and act like a 20th centuri dictatorship
p4615
aVand we also have to affirm all the fledgl democraci in that region you know the estonian the lithuanian the latvian the pole the czech that we are in fact go to be support and in solidar with them in their effort they are member of nato
p4616
aVand to countri like georgia and the ukrain i think we have to insist that they are free to join nato if they meet the requir and they should have a membership action plan immedi to start bring them in
p4617
aVnow we also can t return to a cold war postur with respect to russia it s import that we recogn there are go to be some area of common interest one is nuclear prolifer
p4618
aVthey have not onli 15 000 nuclear warhead but they ve got enough to make anoth 40 000 and some of those loos nuke could fall into the hand of al qaeda
p4619
aVthis is an area where i ve led on in the senat work with a republican rank member of the senat foreign relat committe dick lugar to deal with the prolifer of loos nuclear weapon that s an area where we re go to have to work with russia
p4620
aVbut we have to have a presid who is clear that you don t deal with russia base on stare into his eye and see his soul you deal with russia base on what are your what are the nation secur interest of the unit state of america
p4621
aVand we have to recogn that the way they ve been behav late demand a sharp respons from the intern communiti and our alli
p4622
aVwell i was interest in senat obama s reaction to the russian aggress against georgia his first statement was both side ought to show restraint
p4623
aVagain a littl bit of naivet there he doesn t understand that russia commit serious aggress against georgia and russia has now becom a nation fuel by petro dollar that is basic a kgb apparatchik run govern
p4624
aVi look into mr putin s eye and i saw three letter a k a g and a b and their aggress in georgia is not accept behavior
p4625
aVi don t believ we re go to go back to the cold war i am sure that that will not happen but i do believ that we need to bolster our friend and alli and that wasn t just about a problem between georgia and russia it had everyth to do with energi
p4626
aVthere s a pipelin that run from the caspian through georgia through turkey and of cours we know that the russian control other sourc of energi into europ which they have use from time to time
p4627
aVit s not accident that the presid of latvia estonia lithuania poland and ukrain flew to georgia flew to tbilisi where i have spent signific amount of time with a great young presid misha saakashvili
p4628
aVand they show solidar with them but also they are veri concern about the russian threat to regain their status of the old russian to regain their status of the old russian empir
p4629
aVnow i think the russian ought to understand that we will support we the unit state will support the inclus of georgia and ukrain in the natur process inclus into nato
p4630
aVwe also ought to make it veri clear that the russian are in violat of their ceas fire agreement they have station addit troop in abkhazia and south ossetia
p4631
aVby the way i went there onc and we went insid and drove in and there was a huge poster and this is this is georgian territori and there was a huge poster of vladimir putin and it said vladimir putin our presid
p4632
aVit was veri clear the russian intent toward georgia they were just wait to seiz the opportun
p4633
aVsure but but let me let me point out i also warn about fanni mae and freddi mac and warn about corpor greed and excess and ceo pay and all that a lot of us saw this train wreck come
p4634
aVso this is a veri difficult situat we want to work with the russian but we also have everi right to expect the russian to behav in a fashion and keep with a with a with a countri who respect intern boundari and the norm of intern behavior
p4635
aVand watch ukrain this whole thing has got a lot to do with ukrain crimea the base of the russian fleet in sevastopol and the breakdown of the polit process in ukrain between tymoshenko and yushchenko is a veri serious problem
p4636
aVso watch ukrain and let s make sure that we that the ukrainian understand that we are their friend and alli
p4637
aVno actual i think senat mccain and i agre for the most part on these issu obvious i disagre with this notion that somehow we did not forc object to russian go into georgia
p4638
aVi immedi said that this was illeg and objection and absolut i want a cessat of the violenc becaus it put an enorm strain on georgia and that s whi i was the first to say that we have to rebuild the georgian economi and call for a billion dollar that has now gone in to help them rebuild
p4639
aVbecaus part of russia s intent here was to weaken the economi to the point where presid saakashvili was so weaken that he might be replac by somebodi that putin favor more
p4640
aVtwo point i think are import to think about when it come to russia
p4641
aVno 1 is we have to have foresight and anticip some of these problem so back in april i warn the administr that you had russian peacekeep in georgian territori that made no sens whatsoev
p4642
aVand what we need to do was replac them with intern peacekeep and a special envoy to resolv the crisi befor it boil over
p4643
aVbut there s also the issu of respons you ve mention presid dwight david eisenhow presid eisenhow on the night befor the normandi invas went into his room and he wrote out two letter
p4644
aVthat wasn t done but had it been done it s possibl we could have avoid the issu
p4645
aVthe second point i want to make is is the issu of energi russia is in part resurg and putin is feel power becaus of petro dollar as senat mccain mention
p4646
aVthat mean that we as one of the biggest consum of oil 25 percent of the world s oil have to have an energi strategi not just to deal with russia but to deal with mani of the rogu state we ve talk about iran venezuela
p4647
aVand that mean yes increas domest product and off shore drill but we onli have 3 percent of the world s oil suppli and we use 25 percent of the world s oil so we can t simpli drill our way out of the problem
p4648
aVwhat we re go to have to do is to approach it through altern energi like solar and wind and biodiesel and yes nuclear energi clean coal technolog and you know i ve got a plan for us to make a signific invest over the next 10 year to do that
p4649
aVand i have to say senat mccain and i i think agre on the import of energi but senat mccain mention earlier the import of look at a record
p4650
aVover 26 year senat mccain vote 23 time against altern energi like solar and wind and biodiesel
p4651
aVand so we we we ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it come to energi independ becaus this is probabl go to be just as vital for our economi and the pain that peopl are feel at the pump and you know winter s come and home heat oil as it is our nation secur and the issu of climat chang that s so import
p4652
aVand although we ve heard a lot about wall street those of you on main street i think have been struggl for a while and you recogn that this could have an impact on all sector of the economi
p4653
aVone of them was a letter congratul the great member of the militari and alli that had conduct and succeed in the greatest invas in histori still to this day and forev
p4654
aVno one from arizona is against solar and senat obama say he s for nuclear but he s against reprocess and he s against store so
p4655
aVthat s just not true john john i m sorri but that s not true
p4656
aVit s hard to get there from here and off shore drill is also someth that is veri import and it is a bridg
p4657
aVand we know that if we drill off shore and exploit a lot of these reserv it will help at temporarili reliev our energi requir and it will have i think an import effect on the price of a barrel of oil
p4658
aVi just have to respond veri quick just to correct just to correct the record
p4659
aVso i want to say that with the nunn lugar thing
p4660
aVjohn
p4661
aVi support nunn lugar back in the earli 1990s when a lot of my colleagu didn t that was the key legisl at the time and put us on the road to elimin this issu of nuclear wast and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of
p4662
aVi i just have to correct the record here i have never said that i object to nuclear wast what i ve said is that we have to store it safe
p4663
aVand he wrote out anoth letter and that was a letter of resign from the unit state armi for the failur of the land at normandi
p4664
aVand senat mccain he say he talk about arizona
p4665
aVi ve got to make this point jim
p4666
aVhe object
p4667
aVi have vote for altern fuel all of my time
p4668
aVhe he he object
p4669
aVhe object
p4670
aVsomehow we ve lost that account i ve been heavili critic becaus i call for the resign of the chairman of the secur and exchang commiss we ve got to start also hold peopl account and we ve got to reward peopl who succeed
p4671
aVno one can be oppos to altern energi
p4672
aVall right fair enough let s move on you ve got one more energi you ve got one more question
p4673
aVi think it s much less than it was the day after 9 11 i think it that we have a safer nation but we are a long way from safe
p4674
aVand i want to tell you that one of the thing i m most proud of among other becaus i have work across the aisl i have a long record on that on a long seri of reform
p4675
aVbut after 9 11 senat joe lieberman and i decid that we need a commiss and that was a commiss to investig 9 11 and find out what happen and fix it
p4676
aVand we were we were oppos by the administr anoth area where i differ with this administr and we were stymi until the famili of 9 11 came and they descend on washington and we got that legisl pass
p4677
aVand there were a seri of recommend as i recal more than 40 and i m happi to say that we ve gotten written into law most of those reform recommend by that commiss i m proud of that work again bipartisan reach across the aisl work togeth democrat and republican alik
p4678
aVso we have a long way to go in our intellig servic we have to do a better job in human intellig and we ve got to to make sure that we have peopl who are train interrog so that we don t ever tortur a prison ever again
p4679
aVbut somehow in washington today and i m afraid on wall street greed is reward excess is reward and corrupt or certain failur to carri out our respons is reward
p4680
aVwe have to make sure that our technolog and intellig capabl are better we have to work more close with our alli i know our alli and i can work much more close with them
p4681
aVbut i can tell you that i think america is safer today than it was on 9 11 but that doesn t mean that we don t have a long way to go
p4682
aVand i d like to remind you also as a result of those recommend we ve probabl had the largest reorgan of govern sinc we establish the defens depart and i think that those men and women in those agenc are do a great job
p4683
aVbut we still have a long way to go befor we can declar america safe and that mean do a better job along our border as well
p4684
aVwell first of all i think that we are safer in some way obvious we ve pour billion of dollar into airport secur we have done some work in term of secur potenti target but we still have a long way to go
p4685
aVwe ve got to make sure that we re harden our chemic site we haven t done enough in term of transit we haven t done enough in term of port
p4686
aVand the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missil come over the sky it s in a suitcas
p4687
aVthis is whi the issu of nuclear prolifer is so import it is the the biggest threat to the unit state is a terrorist get their hand on nuclear weapon
p4688
aVand we we are spend billion of dollar on missil defens and i actual believ that we need missil defens becaus of iran and north korea and the potenti for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapon but i also believ that when we are onli spend a few hundr million dollar on nuclear prolifer then we re make a mistak
p4689
aVas presid of the unit state peopl are go to be held account in my administr and i promis you that that will happen
p4690
aVthe other thing that we have to focus on though is al qaeda they are now oper in 60 countri we can t simpli be focus on iraq we have to go to the root caus and that is in afghanistan and pakistan that s go to be critic we are go to need more cooper with our alli
p4691
aVand one last point i want to make it is import for us to understand that the way we are perceiv in the world is go to make a differ in term of our capac to get cooper and root out terror
p4692
aVand one of the thing that i intend to do as presid is to restor america s stand in the world we are less respect now than we were eight year ago or even four year ago
p4693
aVand this is the greatest countri on earth but becaus of some of the mistak that have been made and i give senat mccain great credit on the tortur issu for have identifi that as someth that undermin our long term secur becaus of those thing we i think are go to have a lot of work to do in the next administr to restor that sens that america is that shine beacon on a hill
p4694
aVbut in the case of missil defens senat obama said it had to be quot proven that wasn t proven when ronald reagan said we would do sdi which is missil defens and it was major a major factor in bring about the end of the cold war
p4695
aVwe seem to come full circl again senat obama still doesn t quit understand or doesn t get it that if we fail in iraq it encourag al qaeda they would establish a base in iraq
p4696
aVthe consequ of defeat which would result from his plan of withdraw and accord to date certain regardless of condit accord to our militari leader accord to everi expert would lead to defeat possibl defeat loss of all the fragil sacrific that we ve made of american blood and treasur which griev us all
p4697
aVall of that would be lost if we follow senat obama s plan to have specif date with withdraw regardless of condit on the ground
p4698
aVand general petraeus say we have had great success but it s veri fragil and we can t do what senat obama want to do
p4699
aVthat is the central issu of our time and i think american will judg veri serious as to whether that s the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next presid of the unit state
p4700
aVoh there s no doubt look over the last eight year this administr along with senat mccain have been sole focus on iraq that has been their prioriti that has been where all our resourc have gone
p4701
aVin the meantim bin laden is still out there he is not captur he is not kill al qaeda is resurg
p4702
aVin the meantim we ve got challeng for exampl with china where we are borrow billion of dollar they now hold a trillion dollar worth of our debt and they are activ in countri like in region like latin america and asia and africa they are the conspicu of their presenc is onli match by our absenc becaus we ve been focus on iraq
p4703
aVwe have weaken our capac to project power around the world becaus we have view everyth through this singl len not to mention look at our economi we are now spend 10 billion or more everi month
p4704
aVand that mean we can t provid health care to peopl who need it we can t invest in scienc and technolog which will determin whether or not we are go to be competit in the long term
p4705
aVthere has never been a countri on earth that saw it economi declin and yet maintain it militari superior so this is a nation secur issu
p4706
aVwe haven t adequ fund veteran care i sit on the veteran affair committe and we ve got i meet veteran all across the countri who are tri to figur out how can i get disabl payment i ve got post traumat stress disord and yet i can t get treatment
p4707
aVso we have put all chip in right there and nobodi is talk about lose this war what we are talk about is recogn that the next presid has to have a broader strateg vision about all the challeng that we face
p4708
aVwell i think senat mccain s absolut right that we need more respons but we need it not just when there s a crisi i mean we ve had year in which the reign econom ideolog has been what s good for wall street but not what s good for main street
p4709
aVthat s been miss over the last eight year that sens is someth that i want to restor
p4710
aVi ve been involv as i mention to you befor in virtual everi major nation secur challeng we ve face in the last 20 some year there are some advantag to experi and knowledg and judgment
p4711
aVand i and i honest don t believ that senat obama has the knowledg or experi and has made the wrong judgment in a number of area includ his initi reaction to russian invas aggress in georgia to his you know we ve seen this stubborn befor in this administr to cling to a belief that somehow the surg has not succeed and fail to acknowledg that he was wrong about the surg is show to me that we that that we need more flexibl in a presid of the unit state than that
p4712
aVas far as our other issu that he brought up are concern i know the veteran i know them well and i know that they know that i ll take care of them and i ve been proud of their support and their recognit of my servic to the veteran
p4713
aVand i love them and i ll take care of them and they know that i ll take care of them and that s go to be my job
p4714
aVbut also i have the abil and the knowledg and the background to make the right judgment to keep this countri safe and secur
p4715
aVreform prosper and peac these are major challeng to the unit state of america i don t think i need ani on the job train i m readi to go at it right now
p4716
aVwell let me just make a close point you know my father came from kenya that s where i get my name
p4717
aVand in the 60s he wrote letter after letter to come to colleg here in the unit state becaus the notion was that there was no other countri on earth where you could make it if you tri the ideal and the valu of the unit state inspir the entir world
p4718
aVi don t think ani of us can say that our stand in the world now the way children around the world look at the unit state is the same
p4719
aVand there are folk out there who ve been struggl befor this crisi took place and that s whi it s so import as we solv this short term problem that we look at some of the under issu that have led to wage and incom for ordinari american to go down the a health care system that is broken energi polici that are not work becaus you know 10 day ago john said that the fundament of the economi are sound
p4720
aVand part of what we need to do what the next presid has to do and this is part of our judgment this is part of how we re go to keep america safe is to to send a messag to the world that we are go to invest in issu like educ we are go to invest in issu that that relat to how ordinari peopl are abl to live out their dream
p4721
aVand that is someth that i m go to be commit to as presid of the unit state
p4722
aVjim when i came home from prison i saw our veteran be veri bad treat and it made me sad and i embark on an effort to resolv the pow mia issu which we did in a bipartisan fashion and then i work on normal of relat between our two countri so that our veteran could come all the way home
p4723
aVi guarante you as presid of the unit state i know how to heal the wound of war i know how to deal with our adversari and i know how to deal with our friend
p4724
aVi do not think that they are
p4725
aVand you re wonder how s it go to affect me how s it go to affect my job how s it go to affect my hous how s it go to affect my retir save or my abil to send my children to colleg
p4726
aVwell the john 10 day ago you said that the fundament of the economi are sound and
p4727
aVare you afraid i couldn t hear him
p4728
aVthe and i just fundament disagre and unless we are hold ourselv account day in day out not just when there s a crisi for folk who have power and influenc and can hire lobbyist but for the nurs the teacher the polic offic who frank at the end of each month they ve got a littl financi crisi go on
p4729
aVthey re have to take out extra debt just to make their mortgag payment we haven t been pay attent to them and if you look at our tax polici it s a classic exampl
p4730
aVno i look we ve got to fix the system we ve got fundament problem in the system and main street is pay a penalti for the excess and greed in washington d c and on wall street
p4731
aVso there s no doubt that we have a long way to go and obvious stricter interpret and consolid of the various regulatori agenc that weren t do their job that has brought on this crisi
p4732
aVbut i have a fundament belief in the good and strength of the american worker and the american worker is the most product the most innov america is still the greatest produc export and import
p4733
aVso we have to move swift and we have to move wise and i ve put forward a seri of propos that make sure that we protect taxpay as we engag in this import rescu effort
p4734
aVbut we ve got to get through these time but i have a fundament belief in the unit state of america and i still believ under the right leadership our best day are ahead of us
p4735
aVwell the first thing we have to do is get spend under control in washington it s complet out of control it s gone we have now presid over the largest increas in the size of govern sinc the great societi
p4736
aVwe republican came to power to chang govern and govern chang us and the the worst symptom on this diseas is what my friend tom coburn call earmark as a gateway drug becaus it s a gateway it s a gateway to out of control spend and corrupt
p4737
aVand we have former member of congress now resid in feder prison becaus of the evil of this earmark and pork barrel spend
p4738
aVyou know we spent 3 million to studi the dna of bear in montana i don t know if that was a crimin issu or a patern issu but the fact is that it was 3 million of our taxpay money and it has got to be brought under control
p4739
aVas presid of the unit state i want to assur you i ve got a pen this one s kind of old i ve got a pen and i m go to veto everi singl spend bill that come across my desk i will make them famous you will know their name
p4740
aVnow senat obama you want to know one of the differ a million dollar for everi day that he s been in the unit state senat
p4741
aVi suggest that peopl go up on the web site of citizen against govern wast and they ll look at those project
p4742
aVno 1 we ve got to make sure that we ve got oversight over this whole process 700 billion potenti is a lot of money
p4743
aVthat kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spend in washington d c that s one of the fundament differ that senat obama and i have
p4744
aVwell senat mccain is absolut right that the earmark process has been abus which is whi i suspend ani request for my home state whether it was for senior center or what have you until we clean it up
p4745
aVand he s also right that oftentim lobbyist and special interest are the one that are introduc these kind of request although that wasn t the case with me
p4746
aVbut let s be clear earmark account for 18 billion in last year s budget senat mccain is propos and this is a fundament differ between us 300 billion in tax cut to some of the wealthiest corpor and individu in the countri 300 billion
p4747
aVnow 18 billion is import 300 billion is realli import
p4748
aVand in his tax plan you would have ceo of fortun 500 compani get an averag of 700 000 in reduc tax while leav 100 million american out
p4749
aVso my attitud is we ve got to grow the economi from the bottom up what i ve call for is a tax cut for 95 percent of work famili 95 percent
p4750
aVand that mean that the ordinari american out there who s collect a paycheck everi day they ve got a littl extra money to be abl to buy a comput for their kid to fill up on this gas that is kill them
p4751
aVand over time that i think is go to be a better recip for econom growth than the the polici of presid bush that john mccain want to want to follow
p4752
aVno 2 we ve got to make sure that taxpay when they are put their money at risk have the possibl of get that money back and gain if the market and when the market return
p4753
aVwell again i don t mean to go back and forth but he
p4754
aVsenat obama suspend those request for pork barrel project after he was run for presid of the unit state he didn t happen to see that light dure the first three year as a member of the unit state senat 932 million in request
p4755
aVmayb to senat obama it s not a lot of money but the point is that you see i hear this all the time it s onli 18 billion do you know that it s tripl in the last five year do you know that it s gone complet out of control to the point where it corrupt peopl it corrupt peopl
p4756
aVthat s whi we have as i said peopl under feder indict and charg it s a system that s got to be clean up
p4757
aVi have fought against it my career i have fought against it i was call the sheriff by the one of the senior member of the appropri committe i didn t win miss congeni in the unit state senat
p4758
aVnow senat obama didn t mention that along with his tax cut he is also propos some 800 billion in new spend on new program
p4759
aVnow that s a fundament differ between myself and senat obama i want to cut spend i want to keep tax low the worst thing we could do in this econom climat is to rais peopl s tax
p4760
aVi i don t know where john is get his figur let s just be clear
p4761
aVno 3 we ve got to make sure that none of that money is go to pad ceo bank account or to promot golden parachut
p4762
aVwhat i do is i close corpor loophol stop provid tax cut to corpor that are ship job oversea so that we re give tax break to compani that are invest here in the unit state i make sure that we have a health care system that allow for everyon to have basic coverag
p4763
aVi think those are pretti import prioriti and i pay for everi dime of it
p4764
aVbut let s go back to the origin point john nobodi is deni that 18 billion is import and absolut we need earmark reform and when i m presid i will go line by line to make sure that we are not spend money unwis
p4765
aVbut the fact is that elimin earmark alon is not a recip for how we re go to get the middl class back on track
p4766
aVwell well let me give you an exampl of what senat obama find objection the busi tax
p4767
aVright now the unit state of american busi pay the second highest busi tax in the world 35 percent ireland pay 11 percent
p4768
aVnow if you re a busi person and you can locat ani place in the world then obvious if you go to the countri where it s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent you re go to be abl to creat job increas your busi make more invest et cetera
p4769
aVi want to cut that busi tax i want to cut it so that busi will remain in in the unit state of america and creat job
p4770
aVbut again i want to return it s a lot more than 18 billion in pork barrel spend i can tell you it s rife it s throughout
p4771
aVthank you gwen thank you thank you
p4772
aVi want to go back to the energi plan though becaus this is this is an import one that barack obama he vote for in 05
p4773
aVsenat biden you would rememb that in that energi plan that obama vote for that s what gave those oil compani those big tax break your run mate vote for that
p4774
aVyou know what i had to do in the state of alaska i had to take on those oil compani and tell them no you know ani of the greed there that has been kind of instrument i guess in their mode of oper that wasn t go to happen in my state
p4775
aVand that s whi tillerson at exxon and mulva at conocophillip bless their heart they re do what they need to do as corpor ceo but they re not my biggest fan becaus what i had to do up there in alaska was to break up a monopoli up there and say you know the peopl are go to come first and we re go to make sure that we have valu given to the peopl of alaska with those resourc
p4776
aVand those huge tax break aren t come to the big multin corpor anymor not when it advers affect the peopl who live in a state and in this case in a countri who should be benefit at the same time so it was barack obama who vote for that energi plan that gave those tax break to the oil compani that i then had to turn around as a governor of an energi produc state and kind of undo in my own area of expertis and that s energi
p4777
aVthere is not and how long have i been at this like five week so there hasn t been a whole lot that i ve promis except to do what is right for the american peopl put govern back on the side of the american peopl stop the greed and corrupt on wall street
p4778
aVand the rescu plan has got to includ that massiv oversight that american are expect and deserv and i don t believ that john mccain has made ani promis that he would not be abl to keep either
p4779
aVagain let me let s talk about those tax break barack obama obama vote for an energi bill becaus for the first time it had real support for altern energi
p4780
aVwhen there were separ vote on elimin the tax break for the oil compani barack obama vote to elimin them john did not
p4781
aVand let me just ask a rhetor question if john realli want to elimin them whi is he ad to his budget an addit 4 billion in tax cut for exxonmobil of the world that in fact alreadi have made 600 billion sinc 2001
p4782
aVand look i agre with the governor she impos a windfal profit tax up there in alaska that s what barack obama and i want to do
p4783
aVwe want to be abl to do for all of you american give you back 1 000 buck like she s been abl to give back money to her folk back there
p4784
aVbut john mccain will not support a windfal profit tax they ve made 600 billion sinc 2001 and john mccain want to give them all by itself separ no addit bill all by itself anoth 4 billion tax cut
p4785
aVif that is not proof of what i say i m not sure what can be so i hope the governor is abl to convinc john mccain to support our windfal profit tax which she support in alaska and i give her credit for it
p4786
aVyes i would have but here again there have there have been so mani chang in the condit of our economi in just even these past week that there has been more and more revel made awar now to american about the corrupt and the greed on wall street
p4787
aVwe need to look back even two year ago and we need to be appreci of john mccain s call for reform with fanni mae with freddi mac with the mortgag lender too who were start to realli kind of rear that head of abus
p4788
aVand the colleagu in the senat weren t go to go there with him so we have john mccain to thank for at least warn peopl and we also have john mccain to thank for bring in a bipartisan effort peopl to the tabl so that we can start put polit asid even put a campaign asid and just do what s right to fix this econom problem that we are in
p4789
aVit is a crisi it s a toxic mess realli on main street that s affect wall street and now we have to be ever vigil and also make sure that credit market don t seiz up that s where the main streeter like me that s where we would realli feel the effect
p4790
aVwell mortgag holder didn t pay the price onli 10 percent of the peopl who are have been affect by this whole switch from chapter 7 to chapter 13 it get complic
p4791
aVbut the point of this barack obama saw the glass as half empti i saw it as half full we disagre on that and 85 senat vote one way and 15 vote the other way
p4792
aVbut here s the deal barack obama point out two year ago that there was a subprim mortgag crisi and wrote to the secretari of treasuri and he said you d better get on the stick here you d better look at it
p4793
aVjohn mccain said as earli as last decemb quot i m paraphras i m surpris about this subprim mortgag crisi number one
p4794
aVnumber two with regard to bankruptci now gwen what we should be do now and barack obama and i support it we should be allow bankruptci court to be abl to re adjust not just the interest rate you re pay on your mortgag to be abl to stay in your home but be abl to adjust the princip that you owe the princip that you owe
p4795
aVthat would keep peopl in their home actual help bank by keep it from go under but john mccain as i understand it i m not sure of this but i believ john mccain and the governor don t support that there are way to help peopl now and there way that we re offer are not be support by by the bush administr nor do i believ by john mccain and governor palin
p4796
aVthat is not so but becaus that s just a quick answer i want to talk about again my record on energi versus your ticket s energi ticket also
p4797
aVi think that this is import to come back to with that energi polici plan again that was vote for in 05
p4798
aVwhen we talk about energi we have to consid the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to becom energi independ
p4799
aVit s a nonsens posit that we are in when we have domest suppli of energi all over this great land and east coast politician who don t allow energi produc state like alaska to produc these to tap into them and instead we re reli on foreign countri to produc for us
p4800
aVwe re circul about 700 billion a year into foreign countri some who do not like america they certain don t have our best interest at heart instead of those dollar circul here creat ten of thousand of job and allow domest suppli of energi to be tap into and start flow into these veri veri hungri market
p4801
aVenergi independ is the key to this nation s futur to our econom futur and to our nation secur so when we talk about energi plan it s not just about who got a tax break and who didn t and we re not give oil compani tax break but it s about a heck of a lot more than that
p4802
aVenergi independ is the key to america s futur
p4803
aVyes well as the nation s onli arctic state and be the governor of that state alaska feel and see impact of climat chang more so than ani other state and we know that it s real
p4804
aVi m not one to attribut everi man activ of man to the chang in the climat there is someth to be said also for man s activ but also for the cyclic temperatur chang on our planet
p4805
aVbut there are real chang go on in our climat and i don t want to argu about the caus what i want to argu about is how are we go to get there to posit affect the impact
p4806
aVwe have got to clean up this planet we have got to encourag other nation also to come along with us with the impact of climat chang what we can do about that
p4807
aVas governor i was the first governor to form a climat chang sub cabinet to start deal with the impact we ve got to reduc emiss john mccain is right there with an all of the abov approach to deal with climat chang impact
p4808
aVwe ve got to becom energi independ for that reason also as we reli more and more on other countri that don t care as much about the climat as we do we re allow them to produc and to emit and even pollut more than america would ever stand for so even in deal with climat chang it s all the more reason that we have an all of the abov approach tap into altern sourc of energi and conserv fuel conserv our petroleum product and our hydrocarbon so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climat chang
p4809
aVwell i think it is manmad i think it s clear manmad and look this probabl explain the biggest fundament differ between john mccain and barack obama and sarah palin and joe biden governor palin and joe biden
p4810
aVif you don t understand what the caus is it s virtual imposs to come up with a solut we know what the caus is the caus is manmad that s the caus that s whi the polar icecap is melt
p4811
aVnow let s look at the fact we have 3 percent of the world s oil reserv we consum 25 percent of the oil in the world john mccain has vote 20 time in the last decad and a half against fund altern energi sourc clean energi sourc wind solar biofuel
p4812
aVthe way in which we can stop the greenhous gase from emit we believ barack obama believ by invest in clean coal and safe nuclear we can not onli creat job in wind and solar here in the unit state we can export it
p4813
aVchina is build one to three new coal fire plant burn dirti coal per week it s pollut not onli the atmospher but the west coast of the unit state we should export the technolog by invest in clean coal technolog
p4814
aVwe should be creat job john mccain has vote 20 time against fund altern energi sourc and think i guess the onli answer is drill drill drill drill we must but it will take 10 year for one drop of oil to come out of ani of the well that are go to begun to be drill
p4815
aVlet me begin by thank you gwen for host this
p4816
aVin the meantim we re all go to be in real troubl
p4817
aVi have alway support it that s a fact
p4818
aVyes senat mccain doe support this the chant is drill babi drill and that s what we hear all across this countri in our ralli becaus peopl are so hungri for those domest sourc of energi to be tap into they know that even in my own energi produc state we have billion of barrel of oil and hundr of trillion of cubic feet of clean green natur gas and we re build a near 40 billion natur gas pipelin which is north america s largest and most you expens infrastructur project ever to flow those sourc of energi into hungri market
p4819
aVbarack obama and senat biden you ve said no to everyth in tri to find a domest solut to the energi crisi that we re in you even call drill safe environment friend drill offshor as rape the outer continent shelf
p4820
aVthere with new technolog with tini footprint even on land it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that but also in that all of the abov approach that senat mccain support the altern fuel will be tap into the nuclear the clean coal
p4821
aVi was surpris to hear you mention that becaus you had said that there isn t anyth such a thing as clean coal and i think you said it in a rope line too at one of your ralli
p4822
aVi do i do
p4823
aVand governor it s a pleasur to meet you and it s a pleasur to be with you
p4824
aVabsolut absolut we do we call for set hard target number one
p4825
aVoh i m sorri
p4826
aVoh on clean coal my record just take a look at the record my record for 25 year has support clean coal technolog a comment made in a rope line was taken out of context i was talk about export that technolog to china so when they burn their dirti coal it won t be as dirti it will be clean
p4827
aVbut here s the bottom line gwen how do we deal with global warm with continu addit to carbon emiss and if the onli answer you have is oil and john and the governor say john is for everyth
p4828
aVwell whi did john vote 20 time mayb he s for everyth as long as it s not help forward by the govern mayb he s for everyth if the free market take care of it i don t know but he vote 20 time against fund altern energi sourc
p4829
aVi think it s neither the best or worst of washington but it s evid of the fact that the econom polici of the last eight year have been the worst econom polici we ve ever had as a consequ you ve seen what s happen on wall street
p4830
aVwell not if it goe closer and closer toward redefin the tradit definit of marriag between one man and one woman and unfortun that s sometim where those step lead
p4831
aVbut i also want to clarifi if there s ani kind of suggest at all from my answer that i would be anyth but toler of adult in america choos their partner choos relationship that they deem best for themselv you know i am toler and i have a veri divers famili and group of friend and even within that group you would see some who may not agre with me on this issu some veri dear friend who don t agre with me on this issu
p4832
aVbut in that toler also no one would ever propos not in a mccain palin administr to do anyth to prohibit say visit in a hospit or contract be sign negoti between parti
p4833
aVbut i will tell american straight up that i don t support defin marriag as anyth but between one man and one woman and i think through nuanc we can go round and round about what that actual mean
p4834
aVbut i m be as straight up with american as i can in my non support for anyth but a tradit definit of marriag
p4835
aVno barack obama nor i support redefin from a civil side what constitut marriag we do not support that that is basic the decis to be abl to be abl to be left to faith and peopl who practic their faith the determin what you call it
p4836
aVthe bottom line though is and i m glad to hear the governor i take her at her word obvious that she think there should be no civil right distinct none whatsoev between a commit gay coupl and a commit heterosexu coupl if that s the case we realli don t have a differ
p4837
aVif you need ani more proof posit of how bad the econom theori have been this excess deregul the failur to overse what was go on let wall street run wild i don t think you need ani more evid than what you see now
p4838
aVyour question to him was whether he support gay marriag and my answer is the same as his and it is that i do not
p4839
aVi am veri thank that we do have a good plan and the surg and the counterinsurg strategi in iraq that has proven to work i am thank that that is part of the plan implement under a great american hero general petraeus and push hard by anoth great american senat john mccain
p4840
aVi know that the other ticket oppos this surg in fact even oppos fund for our troop in iraq and afghanistan barack obama vote against fund troop there after promis that he would not do so
p4841
aVand senat biden i respect you when you call him out on that you said that his vote was polit and you said it would cost live and barack obama at first said he would not do that he turn around under polit pressur and he vote against fund the troop we do have a plan for withdraw we don t need earli withdraw out of iraq we cannot afford to lose there or we re go to be no better off in the war in afghanistan either we have got to win in iraq
p4842
aVand with the surg that has work we re now down to presurg number in iraq that s where we can be we can start put more troop in afghanistan as we also work with our nato alli who are there strengthen us and we need to grow our militari we cannot afford to lose against al qaeda and the shia extremist who are still there still fight us but we re get closer and closer to victori and it would be a travesti if we quit now in iraq
p4843
aVso the congress has been put democrat and republican have been put in a veri difficult spot but barack obama laid out four basic criteria for ani kind of rescu plan here
p4844
aVgwen with all due respect i didn t hear a plan barack obama offer a clear plan shift respons to iraqi over the next 16 month draw down our combat troop iron the same plan that maliki the prime minist of iraq and georg bush are now negoti the onli odd man out here onli one left out is john mccain number one number two with regard to barack obama not quot fund the troop john mccain vote the exact same way john mccain vote against fund the troop becaus of an amend he vote against had a timelin in it to draw down american troop and john said i m not go to fund the troop if in fact there s a time line barack obama and i agre fulli and complet on one thing you ve got to have a time line to draw down the troop and shift respons to the iraqi
p4845
aVwe re spend 10 billion a month while iraqi have an 80 billion surplus barack say it s time for them to spend their own money and have the 400 000 militari we train for them begin to take their own respons and gradual over 16 month withdraw john mccain this is a fundament differ between us we ll end this war for john mccain there s no end in sight to end this war fundament differ we will end this war
p4846
aVyour plan is a white flag of surrend in iraq and that is not what our troop need to hear today that s for sure and it s not what our nation need to be abl to count on you guy oppos the surg the surg work barack obama still can t admit the surg work
p4847
aVwe ll know when we re finish in iraq when the iraqi govern can govern it peopl and when the iraqi secur forc can secur it peopl and our command on the ground will tell us when those condit have been met and maliki and talabani also in work with us are know again that we are get closer and closer to that point that victori that s within sight
p4848
aVnow you said regard senat mccain s militari polici there senat biden that you support a lot of these thing in fact you said in fact that you want to run you d be honor to run with him on the ticket that s an indic i think of some of the support that you had at least until you becam the vp pick here
p4849
aVyou also said that barack obama was not readi to be command in chief and i know again that you oppos the move he made to tri to cut off fund for the troop and i respect you for that i don t know how you can defend that posit now but i know that you know especi with your son in the nation guard and i have great respect for your famili also and the honor that you show our militari barack obama though anoth stori there anyon i think who can cut off fund for the troop after promis not to is anoth stori
p4850
aVjohn mccain vote to cut off fund for the troop let me say that again john mccain vote against an amend contain 1 billion 600 million that i had gotten to get mrap those thing that are protect the governor s son and pray god my son and a lot of other son and daughter
p4851
aVhe vote against it he vote against fund becaus he said the amend had a time line in it to end this war he didn t like that but let s get straight who has been right and wrong john mccain and dick cheney said while i was say we would not be greet as liber we would not this war would take a decad and not a day not a week and not six month we would not be out of there quick john mccain was say the sunni and shia got along with each other without read the histori of the last 700 year john mccain said there would be enough oil to pay for this john mccain has been dead wrong i love him as my mother would say god love him but he s been dead wrong on the fundament issu relat to the conduct of the war barack obama has been right there are the fact
p4852
aVhe first of all said there has to be oversight we re not go to write ani check to anybodi unless there s oversight for the of the secretari of treasuri
p4853
aVwell they re both extrem danger i alway am focus as you know gwen i have been focus on for a long time along with barack on pakistan pakistan alreadi has nuclear weapon pakistan alreadi has deploy nuclear weapon pakistan s weapon can alreadi hit israel and the mediterranean iran get a nuclear weapon would be veri veri destabil they are more than they are not close to get a nuclear weapon that s abl to be deploy so they re both veri danger they both would be game changer
p4854
aVbut look here s what the fundament problem i have with john s polici about terror instabl john continu to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in iraq i promis you if an attack come in the homeland it s go to come as our secur servic have said it is go to come from al qaeda plan in the hill of afghanistan and pakistan that s where they live that s where they are that s where it will come from and right now that resid in pakistan a stabl govern need to be establish we need to support that democraci by help them not onli with their militari but with their govern and their econom well be
p4855
aVthere have been 7 000 madrass built along that border we should be help them build school to compet for those heart and mind of the peopl in the region so that we re actual abl to take on terror and by the way that s where bin laden live and we will go at him if we have actual intellig
p4856
aVboth are extrem danger of cours and as for who coin that central war on terror be in iraq it was the general petraeus and al qaeda both leader there and it s probabl the onli thing that they re ever go to agre on but that it was a central war on terror is in iraq you don t have to believ me or john mccain on that i would believ petraeus and the leader of al qaeda
p4857
aVan arm nuclear arm especi iran is so extrem danger to consid they cannot be allow to acquir nuclear weapon period israel is in jeopardi of cours when we re deal with ahmadinejad as a leader of iran iran claim that israel as he term it a stink corps a countri that should be wipe off the face of the earth now a leader like ahmadinejad who is not sane or stabl when he say thing like that is not one whom we can allow to acquir nuclear energi nuclear weapon ahmadinejad kim jong il the castro brother other who are danger dictat are one that barack obama has said he would be will to meet with without precondit be met first
p4858
aVand an issu like that taken up by a presidenti candid goe beyond naivet and goe beyond poor judgment a statement that he made like that is downright danger becaus leader like ahmadinejad who would seek to acquir nuclear weapon and wipe off the face of the earth an alli like we have in israel should not be met with without precondit and diplomat effort be undertaken first
p4859
aVno and dr henri kissing especi i had a good convers with him recent and he share with me his passion for diplomaci and that s what john mccain and i would engag in also but again with some of these dictat who hate america and hate what we stand for with our freedom our democraci our toler our respect for women s right those who would tri to destroy what we stand for cannot be met with just sit down on a presidenti level as barack obama had said he would be will to do that is beyond bad judgment that is danger
p4860
aVhe second said you have to focus on homeown and folk on main street
p4861
aVno diplomaci is veri import first and foremost that is what we would engag in but diplomaci is hard work by serious peopl it s line out clear object and have your friend and your alli readi to back you up there and have sanction line up befor ani kind of presidenti summit would take place
p4862
aVcan i clarifi this this is simpli not true about barack obama he did not say sit down with ahmadinejad
p4863
aVthe fact of the matter is it surpris me that senat mccain doesn t realiz that ahmadinejad doe not control the secur apparatus in iran the theocraci control the secur apparatus number one
p4864
aVnumber two five secretari of state did say we should talk with and sit down
p4865
aVnow john and governor palin now say they re all for they have a passion i think the phrase was a passion for diplomaci and that we have to bring our friend and alli along
p4866
aVour friend and alli have been say gwen sit down talk talk talk our friend and alli have been say that five secretari of state three of them republican
p4867
aVand john mccain has said he would go along with an agreement but he wouldn t sit down now how do you do that when you don t have your administr sit down and talk with the adversari
p4868
aVand look what presid bush did after five year he final sent a high rank diplomat to meet with the highest rank diplomat in iran in europ to tri to work out an arrang
p4869
aVour alli are on that same page and if we don t go the extra mile on diplomaci what make you think the alli are go to sit with us
p4870
aVthird he said that you have to treat the taxpay like investor in this case
p4871
aVthe last point i ll make john mccain said as recent as a coupl of week ago he wouldn t even sit down with the govern of spain a nato alli that has troop in afghanistan with us now i find that incred
p4872
aVyes
p4873
aVa two state solut is the solut and secretari rice have recent met with leader on one side or the other there also still in these wane day of the bush administr tri to forg that peac and that need to be done and that will be top of an agenda item also under a mccain palin administr
p4874
aVisrael is our strongest and best alli in the middl east we have got to assur them that we will never allow a second holocaust despit again warn from iran and ani other countri that would seek to destroy israel that that is what they would like to see
p4875
aVwe will support israel a two state solut build our embassi also in jerusalem those thing that we look forward to be abl to accomplish with this peac seek nation and they have a track record of be abl to forg these peac agreement
p4876
aVthey succeed with jordan they succeed with egypt i m sure that we re go to see more success there also
p4877
aVit s got to be a commit of the unit state of america though and i can promis you in a mccain palin administr that commit is there to work with our friend in israel
p4878
aVand last what you have to do is make sure that ceo don t benefit from this becaus this could end up in the long run peopl make money off of this rescu plan
p4879
aVgwen no one in the unit state senat has been a better friend to israel than joe biden i would have never ever join this ticket were i not absolut sure barack obama share my passion
p4880
aVbut you ask a question about whether or not this administr s polici had made sens or someth to that effect it has been an abject failur this administr s polici
p4881
aVin fair to secretari rice she s tri to turn it around now in the seventh or eighth year
p4882
aVhere s what the presid said when we said no he insist on elect on the west bank when i said and other said and barack obama said big mistak hama will win you ll legitim them what happen hama won
p4883
aVwhen we kick along with franc we kick hezbollah out of lebanon i said and barack said move nato forc in there fill the vacuum becaus if you don t know if you don t hezbollah will control it
p4884
aVnow what s happen hezbollah is a legitim part of the govern in the countri immedi to the north of israel
p4885
aVthe fact of the matter is the polici of this administr has been an abject failur
p4886
aVand speak of freedom be on the march the onli thing on the march is iran it s closer to a bomb it proxi now have a major stake in lebanon as well as in the gaza strip with hama
p4887
aVwe will chang this polici with thought real live diplomaci that understand that you must back israel in let them negoti support their negoti and stand with them not insist on polici like this administr has ifil has this administr s polici been an abject failur as the senat say governor
p4888
aVno i do not believ that it has been but i m so encourag to know that we both love israel and i think that is a good thing to get to agre on senat biden i respect your posit on that
p4889
aVand so as a consequ of that it bring us back to mayb the fundament disagr between governor palin and me and senat mccain and barack obama and that is that the we re go to fundament chang the focus of the econom polici
p4890
aVno in fact when we talk about the bush administr there s a time too when american are go to say enough is enough with your ticket on constant look backward and point finger and do the blame game
p4891
aVthere have been huge blunder in the war there have been huge blunder throughout this administr as there are with everi administr
p4892
aVbut for a ticket that want to talk about chang and look into the futur there s just too much finger point backward to ever make us believ that that s where you re go
p4893
aVposit chang is come though reform of govern is come we ll learn from the past mistak in this administr and other administr
p4894
aVand we re go to forg ahead with put govern back on the side of the peopl and make sure that our countri come first put obsess partisanship asid
p4895
aVthat s what john mccain has been known for in all these year he has been the maverick he has ruffl feather
p4896
aVbut i know senat biden you have respect for them that and i respect you for acknowledg that but chang is come
p4897
aVlook past is prologu gwen the issu is how differ is john mccain s polici go to be than georg bush s i haven t heard anyth yet
p4898
aVi haven t heard how his polici is go to be differ on iran than georg bush s i haven t heard how his polici is go to be differ with israel than georg bush s i haven t heard how his polici in afghanistan is go to be differ than georg bush s i haven t heard how his polici in pakistan is go to be differ than georg bush s
p4899
aVwe re go to focus on the middl class becaus it s when the middl class is grow the economi grow and everybodi doe well not just focus on the wealthi and corpor america
p4900
aVit may be but so far it is the same as georg bush s and you know where that polici has taken us
p4901
aVwe will make signific chang so onc again we re the most respect nation in the world that s what we re go to do
p4902
aVnuclear weaponri of cours would be the be all end all of just too mani peopl in too mani part of our planet so those danger regim again cannot be allow to acquir nuclear weapon period
p4903
aVour nuclear weaponri here in the u s is use as a deterr and that s a safe stabl way to use nuclear weaponri
p4904
aVbut for those countri north korea also under kim jong il we have got to make sure that we re put the econom sanction on these countri and that we have friend and alli support us in this to make sure that leader like kim jong il and ahmadinejad are not allow to acquir to prolifer or to use those nuclear weapon it is that import
p4905
aVcan we talk about afghanistan real quick also though
p4906
aVok i d like to just realli quick mention there too that when you look back and you say that the bush administr s polici on afghanistan perhap would be the same as mccain and that s not accur
p4907
aVthe surg principl not the exact strategi but the surg principl that have work in iraq need to be implement in afghanistan also and that perhap would be a differ with the bush administr
p4908
aVnow barack obama had said that all we re do in afghanistan is air raid villag and kill civilian and such a reckless reckless comment and untru comment again hurt our caus
p4909
aVthat s not what we re do there we re fight terrorist and we re secur democraci and we re build school for children there so that there is opportun in that countri also there will be a big differ there and we will win in in afghanistan also
p4910
aVi ll talk about both with afghanistan fact matter gwen
p4911
aVthe fact is that our command general in afghanistan said today that a surg the surg principl use in iraq will not well let me say this again now our command general in afghanistan said the surg principl in iraq will not work in afghanistan not joe biden our command general in afghanistan
p4912
aVhe said we need more troop we need govern build we need to spend more money on the infrastructur in afghanistan
p4913
aVlook we have spent more money we spend more money in three week on combat in iraq than we spent on the entireti of the last seven year that we have been in afghanistan build that countri
p4914
aVlet me say that again three week in iraq seven year seven year or six and a half year in afghanistan now that s number one
p4915
aVnumber two with regard to arm control and weapon nuclear weapon requir a nuclear arm control regim john mccain vote against a comprehens nuclear test ban treati that everi republican has support
p4916
aVjohn mccain has oppos amend the nuclear test ban treati with an amend to allow for inspect
p4917
aVjohn mccain has not been has not been the kind of support for deal with and let me put it anoth way my time is almost up
p4918
aVbarack obama first thing he did when he came to the unit state senat new senat reach across the aisl to my colleagu dick lugar a republican and said we ve got to do someth about keep nuclear weapon out of the hand of terrorist
p4919
aVthey put togeth a piec of legisl that in fact was serious and real everi major i shouldn t say everi on the two at least that i name i know that john mccain has been oppos to extend the arm control regim in the world
p4920
aVwell first mcclellan did not say definit the surg principl would not work in afghanistan certain account for differ condit in that differ countri and condit are certain differ we have nato alli help us for one and even the geograph differ are huge but the counterinsurg principl could work in afghanistan mcclellan didn t say anyth opposit of that the counterinsurg strategi go into afghanistan clear hold rebuild the civil societi and the infrastructur can work in afghanistan and those leader who are over there who have also been advis georg bush on this have not said anyth differ but that
p4921
aVwell our command general did say that the fact of the matter is that again i ll just put in perspect while barack and i and chuck hagel and dick lugar have been call for more money to help in afghanistan more troop in afghanistan john mccain was say two year ago quot the reason we don t read about afghanistan anymor in the paper it s succeed
p4922
aVbarack obama was say we need more troop there again we spend in three week on combat mission in iraq more than we spent in the entir time we have been in afghanistan that will chang in a barack obama administr
p4923
aVi think the american public has the stomach for success my recommend on bosnia i admit i was the first one to recommend it they save ten of thousand of live and initi john mccain oppos it along with a lot of other peopl but the end result was it work look what we did in bosnia we took serb croat and bosniak be told by everyon i was told by everyon that this would mean that they had been kill each other for a thousand year it would never work
p4924
aVthank you gwen and i thank the commiss also i appreci this privileg of be abl to be here and speak with american
p4925
aVthere s a relat stabl govern there now as in kosovo with regard to iraq i indic it would be a mistak to i gave the presid the power i vote for the power becaus he said he need it not to go to war but to keep the unit state the un in line to keep sanction on iraq and not let them be lift
p4926
aVi along with dick lugar befor we went to war said if we were to go to war without our alli without the kind of support we need we d be there for a decad and it d cost us ten of billion of dollar john mccain said no it was go to be ok
p4927
aVi don t have the stomach for genocid when it come to darfur we can now impos a no fli zone it s within our capac we can lead nato if we re will to take a hard stand we can i ve been in those camp in chad i ve seen the suffer thousand and ten of thousand have die and are die we should ralli the world to act and demonstr it by our own movement to provid the helicopt to get the 21 000 forc of the african union in there now to stop this genocid
p4928
aVoh yeah it s so obvious i m a washington outsid and someon just not use to the way you guy oper becaus here you vote for the war and now you oppos the war you re one who say as so mani politician do i was for it befor i was against it or vice versa american are crave that straight talk and just want to know hey if you vote for it tell us whi you vote for it and it was a war resolut
p4929
aVand you had support john mccain s militari strategi pretti adam until this race and you had oppos veri adam barack obama s militari strategi includ cut off fund for the troop that attempt all through the primari
p4930
aVand i watch those debat so i rememb what those were all about
p4931
aVbut as for as darfur we can agre on that also the support of the no fli zone make sure that all option are on the tabl there also
p4932
aVamerica is in a posit to help what i ve done in my posit to help as the governor of a state that s pretti rich in natur resourc we have a 40 billion invest fund a save fund call the alaska perman fund
p4933
aVwhen i and other in the legislatur found out we had some million of dollar in sudan we call for divest through legisl of those dollar to make sure we weren t do anyth that would be seen as condon the activ there in darfur that legisl hasn t pass yet but it need to becaus all of us as individu and as humanitarian and as elect offici should do all we can to end those atroc in that region of the world
p4934
aVyou know i think a good baromet here as we tri to figur out has this been a good time or a bad time in america s economi is go to a kid s soccer game on saturday and turn to ani parent there on the sidelin and ask them how are you feel about the economi
p4935
aVabsolut there is a line that should be drawn
p4936
aVi beg to disagre with you again here on whether you support barack obama or john mccain s strategi here again you can say what you want to say a month out befor peopl are ask to vote on this but we listen to the debat
p4937
aVi think tomorrow morn the pundit are go to start do the who said what at what time and we ll have proof of some of this but again john mccain who know how to win a war who s been there and he s face challeng and he know what evil is and know what it take to overcom the challeng here with our militari
p4938
aVhe know to learn from the mistak and blunder we have seen in the war in iraq especi he will know how to implement the strategi work with our command and listen to what they have to say take the polit out of these war issu he ll know how to win a war
p4939
aVand i ll bet you you re go to hear some fear in that parent s voic fear regard the few invest that some of us have in the stock market did we just take a major hit with those invest
p4940
aVgod forbid that would ever happen it would be a nation tragedi of histor proport if it were to happen
p4941
aVbut if it did i would carri out barack obama s polici his polici of reinstat the middl class make sure they get a fair break make sure they have access to afford health insur make sure they get serious tax break make sure we can help their children get to colleg make sure there is an energi polici that lead us in the direct of not onli toward independ and clean environ but an energi polici that creat 5 million new job a foreign polici that end this war in iraq a foreign polici that goe after the one mission the american public gave the presid after 9 11 to get and captur or kill bin laden and to elimin al qaeda a polici that would in fact engag our alli in make sure that we knew we were act on the same page and not dictat
p4942
aVand a polici that would reject the bush doctrin of preemption and regim chang and replac it with a doctrin of prevent and cooper and ladi and gentlemen this is the biggest ticket item that we have in this elect
p4943
aVthis is the most import elect you will ever ever have vote in ani of you sinc 1932 and there s such stark differ i would follow through on barack s polici becaus in essenc i agre with everi major initi he is suggest
p4944
aVand heaven forbid yes that would ever happen no matter how this end up that that would ever happen with either parti
p4945
aVas for disagre with john mccain and how our administr would work what do you expect a team of maverick of cours we re not go to agre on 100 percent of everyth as we discuss anwr there at least we can agre to disagre on that one i will keep push him on anwr i have so appreci he has never ask me to check my opinion at the door and he want a delib debat and healthi debat so we can make good polici
p4946
aVwhat i would do also if that were to ever happen though is to continu the good work he is so commit to of put govern back on the side of the peopl and get rid of the greed and corrupt on wall street and in washington
p4947
aVi think we need a littl bit of realiti from wasilla main street there brought to washington dc
p4948
aVfear about how are we go to afford to send our kid to colleg a fear as small busi owner perhap how we re go to borrow ani money to increas inventori or hire more peopl
p4949
aVso that peopl there can understand how the averag work class famili is view bureaucraci in the feder govern and congress and inact of congress
p4950
aVjust everyday work class american say you know govern just get out of my way if you re go to do ani harm and mandat more thing on me and take more of my money and incom tax and busi tax you re go to have a choic in just a few week here on either support a ticket that want to creat job and bolster our economi and win the war or you re go to be support a ticket that want to increas tax which ultim kill job and is go to hurt our economi
p4951
aVcan i respond look all you have to do is go down union street with me in wilmington or go to kati s restaur or walk into home depot with me where i spend a lot of time and you ask anybodi in there whether or not the econom and foreign polici of this administr has made them better off in the last eight year and then ask them whether there s a singl major initi that john mccain differ with the presid on on tax on iraq on afghanistan on the whole question of how to help educ on the deal with health care
p4952
aVlook the peopl in my neighborhood they get it they get it they know they ve been get the short end of the stick so walk with me in my neighborhood go back to my old neighborhood in claymont an old steel town or go up to scranton with me these peopl know the middl class has gotten the short end the wealthi have done veri well corpor america has been reward it s time we chang it barack obama will chang it
p4953
aVsay it ain t so joe there you go again point backward again you preferenc your whole comment with the bush administr now doggon it let s look ahead and tell american what we have to plan to do for them in the futur you mention educ and i m glad you did i know educ you are passion about with your wife be a teacher for 30 year and god bless her her reward is in heaven right i say too with educ america need to be put a lot more focus on that and our school have got to be realli ramp up in term of the fund that they are deserv teacher need to be paid more i come from a hous full of school teacher my grandma was my dad who is in the audienc today he s a schoolteach had been for mani year my brother who i think is the best schoolteach in the year and here s a shout out to all those third grader at gladi wood elementari school you get extra credit for watch the debat
p4954
aVeduc credit in american has been in some sens in some of our state just accept to be a littl bit lax and we have got to increas the standard no child left behind was implement it s not do the job though we need flexibl in no child left behind we need to put more of an emphasi on the profess of teach we need to make sure that educ in either one of our agenda i think absolut top of the line my kid as public school particip right now it s near and dear to my heart i m veri veri concern about where we re go with educ and we have got to ramp it up and put more attent in that arena
p4955
aVin my comment there it was a lame attempt at a joke and your was a lame attempt at a joke too i guess becaus nobodi got it of cours we know what a vice presid doe
p4956
aVthey didn t get your or mine which one didn t they get
p4957
aVthe baromet there i think is go to be resound that our economi is hurt and the feder govern has not provid the sound oversight that we need and that we deserv and we need reform to that end
p4958
aVno no of cours we know what a vice presid doe and that s not onli to presid over the senat and will take that posit veri serious also i m thank the constitut would allow a bit more author given to the vice presid if that vice presid so chose to exert it in work with the senat and make sure that we are support of the presid s polici and make sure too that our presid understand what our strength are john mccain and i have had good convers about where i would lead with his agenda that is energi independ in america and reform of govern over all and then work with famili of children with special need that s near and dear to my heart also in those arena john mccain has alreadi tap me and said that s where i want you i want you to lead i said i can t wait to get and there go to work with you
p4959
aVgwen i hope we ll get back to educ becaus i don t know ani govern program that john is support not earli educ more money for it the reason no child left behind was left behind the money was left behind we didn t fund it we can get back to that i assum
p4960
aVwith regard to the role of vice presid i had a long talk as i m sure the governor did with her princip in my case with barack let me tell you what barack ask me to do i have a histori of get thing done in the unit state senat john mccain would acknowledg that my record show that on controversi issu i would be the point person for the legisl initi in the unit state congress for our administr i would also when ask if i want a portfolio my respons was no but barack obama indic to me he want me with him to help him govern so everi major decis he ll be make i ll be sit in the room to give my best advic he s presid not me i ll give my best advic
p4961
aVand one of the thing he said earli on when he was choos he said he pick someon who had an independ judgment and wouldn t be afraid to tell him if he disagre that is sort of my reput as you know i look forward to work with barack and play a veri construct role in his presid bring about the kind of chang this countri need
p4962
aVwell our found father were veri wise there in allow through the constitut much flexibl there in the offic of the vice presid and we will do what is best for the american peopl in tap into that posit and usher in an agenda that is support and cooper with the presid s agenda in that posit yeah so i do agre with him that we have a lot of flexibl in there and we ll do what we have to do to administ veri appropri the plan that are need for this nation and it is my execut experi that is part to be attribut to my pick as v p with mccain not onli as a governor but earlier on as a mayor as an oil and gas regul as a busi owner it is those year of experi on an execut level that will be put to good use in the white hous also
p4963
aVvice presid cheney has been the most danger vice presid we ve had probabl in american histori the idea he doesn t realiz that articl i of the constitut defin the role of the vice presid of the unit state that s the execut branch he work in the execut branch he should understand that everyon should understand that
p4964
aVand the primari role of the vice presid of the unit state of america is to support the presid of the unit state of america give that presid his or her best judgment when sought and as vice presid to presid over the senat onli in a time when in fact there s a tie vote the constitut is explicit
p4965
aVnow john mccain thank has been one repres reform two year ago rememb it was john mccain who push so hard with the fanni mae and freddi mac reform measur he sound that warn bell
p4966
aVthe onli author the vice presid has from the legisl standpoint is the vote onli when there is a tie vote he has no author relat to the congress the idea he s part of the legisl branch is a bizarr notion invent by cheney to aggrand the power of a unitari execut and look where it has gotten us it has been veri danger ifil let s talk convent wisdom for a moment the convent wisdom governor palin with you is that your achill heel is that you lack experi your convent wisdom against you is that your achill heel is that you lack disciplin senat biden what id it realli for you governor palin what is it realli for you senat biden start with you governor
p4967
aVmy experi as an execut will be put to good use as a mayor and busi owner and oil and gas regul and then as governor of a huge state a huge energi produc state that is account for much progress toward get our nation energi independ and that s extrem import
p4968
aVbut it wasn t just that experi tap into it was my connect to the heartland of america be a mom one veri concern about a son in the war about a special need child about kid head off to colleg how are we go to pay those tuition bill about time and todd and our marriag in our past where we didn t have health insur and we know what other american are go through as they sit around the kitchen tabl and tri to figur out how are they go to pay out of pocket for health care we ve been there also so that connect was import
p4969
aVbut even more import is that world view that i share with john mccain that world view that say that america is a nation of except and we are to be that shine citi on a hill as presid reagan so beauti said that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologet here we are not perfect as a nation but togeth we repres a perfect ideal and that is democraci and toler and freedom and equal right those thing that we stand for that can be put to good use as a forc for good in this world
p4970
aVjohn mccain and i share that you combin all that with be a team with the onli track record of make a realli a differ in where we ve been and reform that s a good team it s a good ticket
p4971
aVyou re veri kind suggest my onli achill heel is my lack of disciplin
p4972
aVother talk about my excess passion i m not go to chang i have 35 year in public offic peopl can judg who i am i haven t chang in that time
p4973
aVand by the way a record of chang i will place my record and barack s record against john mccain s or anyon els in term of fundament accomplish wrote the crime bill put 100 000 cop on the street wrote the violenc against women act which john mccain vote against both of them was the catalyst to chang the circumst in bosnia led by presid clinton obvious
p4974
aVlook i understand what it s like to be a singl parent when my wife and daughter die and my two son were grave injur i understand what it s like as a parent to wonder what it s like if your kid s go to make it
p4975
aVpeopl in the senat with him his colleagu didn t want to listen to him and wouldn t go toward that reform that was need then i think that the alarm has been heard though and there will be that greater oversight again thank to john mccain s bipartisan effort that he was so instrument in bring folk togeth over this past week even suspend his own campaign to make sure he was put excess polit asid and put the countri first
p4976
aVi understand what it s like to sit around the kitchen tabl with a father who say i ve got to leav champ becaus there s no job here i got to head down to wilmington and when we get enough money honey we ll bring you down
p4977
aVi understand what it s like i m much better off than almost all american now i get a good salari with the unit state senat i live in a beauti hous that s my total invest that i have so i i am much better off now
p4978
aVbut the notion that somehow becaus i m a man i don t know what it s like to rais two kid alon i don t know what it s like to have a child you re not sure is go to is go to make it i understand
p4979
aVi understand as well as with all due respect the governor or anybodi els what it s like for those peopl sit around that kitchen tabl and guess what they re look for help they re look for help they re not look for more of the same
p4980
aVpeopl aren t look for more of the same they are look for chang and john mccain has been the consumm maverick in the senat over all these year
p4981
aVhe s taken shot left and right from the other parti and from within his own parti becaus he s had to take on his own parti when the time was right when he recogn it was time to put partisanship asid and just do what was right for the american peopl that s what i ve done as governor also take on my own parti when i had to and work with both side of the aisl in my cabinet appoint those who would serv regardless of parti democrat independ republican whatev it took to get the job done
p4982
aValso john mccain s maverick posit that he s in that s realli prompt up to and indic by the support that he has look at lieberman and giuliani and romney and lingl and all of us who come from such a divers background of of polici and of partisanship all come togeth at this time recogn he is the man that we need to leav lead in these next four year becaus these are tumultu time
p4983
aVwe have got to win the war we have got to get our economi back on track we have got to not allow the greed and corrupt on wall street anymor
p4984
aVand we have not got to allow the partisanship that has realli been entrench in washington d c no matter who s been in charg when the republican were in charg i didn t see a lot of progress there either when the democrat either though this last go around for the last two year
p4985
aVchang is come and john mccain is the leader of that reform
p4986
aVi ll be veri brief can i respond to that
p4987
aVlook the maverick let s talk about the maverick john mccain is and again i love him he s been a maverick on some issu but he has been no maverick on the thing that matter to peopl s live
p4988
aVhe vote four out of five time for georg bush s budget which put us a half a trillion dollar in debt this year and over 3 trillion in debt sinc he s got there
p4989
aVhe has not been a maverick in provid health care for peopl he has vote against he vote includ anoth 3 6 million children in coverag of the exist health care plan when he vote in the unit state senat
p4990
aVhe s not been a maverick when it come to educ he has not support tax cut and signific chang for peopl be abl to send their kid to colleg
p4991
aVhe s not been a maverick on the war he s not been a maverick on virtual anyth that genuin affect the thing that peopl realli talk about around their kitchen tabl
p4992
aVcan we send can we get mom s mri can we send mari back to school next semest we can t we can t make it how are we go to heat the heat the hous this winter
p4993
aVhe vote against even provid for what they call liheap for assist to peopl with oil price go through the roof in the winter
p4994
aVso maverick he is not on the import critic issu that affect peopl at that kitchen tabl
p4995
aVyes i can when i got to the unit state senat and went on the judiciari committe as a young lawyer i was of the view and had been train in the view that the onli thing that matter was whether or not a nomine appoint suggest by the presid had a judici tempera had not commit a crime of moral turpitud and was had been a good student
p4996
aVand it didn t take me long it was hard to chang but it didn t take me long but it took about five year for me to realiz that the ideolog of that judg make a big differ
p4997
aVthat s whi i led the fight against judg bork had he been on the court i suspect there would be a lot of chang that i don t like and the american peopl wouldn t like includ everyth from roe v wade to issu relat to civil right and civil liberti
p4998
aVand so that that that was one of the intellectu chang that took place in my career as i got a close look at it and that s whi i was the first chairman of the judiciari committe to forthright state that it matter what your judici philosophi is the american peopl have a right to understand it and to know it
p4999
aVbut i did chang on that and and i m glad i did
p5000
aVthere have been time where as mayor and governor we have pass budget that i did not veto and that i think could be consid as someth that i quasi cave in if you will but know that it was the right thing to do in order to progress the agenda for that year and to work with the legisl bodi that bodi that actual hold the purs string
p5001
aVso there were time when i want to zero base budget and to cut tax even more and i didn t have enough support in order to accomplish that
p5002
aVwell that s what i ve done my whole career gwen on veri veri controversi issu from deal with violenc against women to put 100 000 polic offic on the street to tri to get someth done about the genocid in that was go on in bosnia
p5003
aVbut on the major principl thing no there hasn t been someth that i ve had to compromis on becaus we ve alway seem to find a way to work togeth up there in alaska what we have done is with bipartisan effort is work togeth and again not care who get the credit for what as we accomplish thing up there
p5004
aVand that s been just a part of the oper that i want to particip in and that s what we re go to do in washington d c also bring in both side togeth john mccain is known for do that also in order to get the work done for the american peopl
p5005
aVwell again i believ john mccain were he here and this is a danger thing to say in the middl of an elect but he would acknowledg what i m about to say
p5006
aVi have been abl to work across the aisl on some of the most controversi issu and chang my parti s mind as well as republican becaus i learn a lesson from mike mansfield
p5007
aVmike mansfield a former leader of the senat said to me one day he i made a critic of jess helm he said what would you do if i told you jess helm and dot helm had adopt a child who had brace and was in real need i said i d feel like a jerk
p5008
aVhe said joe understand one thing everyon s sent here for a reason becaus there s someth in them that their folk like don t question their motiv
p5009
aVi have never sinc that moment in my first year question the motiv of anoth member of the congress or senat with whom i ve disagre i ve question their judgment
p5010
aVi think that s whi i have the respect i have and have been abl to work as well as i ve been abl to have work in the unit state senat that s the fundament chang barack obama and i will be bring to this parti not question other peopl s motiv
p5011
aVand i i have been abl to reach across the aisl i think it s fair to say that i have almost as mani friend on the republican side of the aisl as i do the democrat side of the aisl
p5012
aVyou do what i did as governor and you appoint peopl regardless of parti affili democrat independ republican you you walk the walk you don t just talk the talk
p5013
aVand even in my own famili it s a veri divers famili and we have folk of all polit persuas in there also so i ve grown up just know that you know at the end of the day as long as we re all work togeth for the greater good it s go to be ok
p5014
aVbut the polici and the propos have got to speak for themselv also and again voter on novemb 4th are go to have that choic to either support a ticket that support polici that creat job
p5015
aVyou do that by lower tax on american worker and on our busi and you build up infrastructur and you rein in govern spend and you make our our nation energi independ
p5016
aVor you support a ticket that support polici that will kill job by increas tax and that s what the track record show is a desir to increas tax increas spend a trillion dollar spend propos that s on the tabl that s go to hurt our countri and say no to energi independ clear choic on novemb 4th
p5017
aVwell again gwen i do want to thank you and the commiss this is such an honor for me
p5018
aVand i appreci too senat biden get to meet you final also and get to debat with you and i would like more opportun for this
p5019
aVi like be abl to answer these tough question without the filter even of the mainstream media kind of tell viewer what they ve just heard i d rather be abl to just speak to the american peopl like we just did
p5020
aVand it s so import that the american peopl know of the choic that they have on novemb 4th
p5021
aVbut am i abl to respond to are we abl to stay on the on the topic
p5022
aVi want to assur you that john mccain and i we re go to fight for america we re go to fight for the middl class averag everyday american famili like mine
p5023
aVi ve been there i know what the hurt are i know what the challeng are and thank god i know what the joy are too of live in america we are so bless and i ve alway been proud to be an american and so has john mccain
p5024
aVwe have to fight for our freedom also econom and our nation secur freedom
p5025
aVit was ronald reagan who said that freedom is alway just one generat away from extinct we don t pass it to our children in the bloodstream we have to fight for it and protect it and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same or we re go to find ourselv spend our sunset year tell our children and our children s children about a time in america back in the day when men and women were free
p5026
aVwe will fight for it and there is onli one man in this race who has realli ever fought for you and that s senat john mccain
p5027
aVgwen thank you for do this and the commiss and governor it realli was a pleasur get to meet you
p5028
aVlook folk this is the most import elect you ve ever vote in your entir life no one can deni that the last eight year we ve been dug into a veri deep hole here at home with regard to our economi and abroad in term of our credibl and there s a need for fundament chang in our econom philosophi as well as our foreign polici
p5029
aVand barack obama and i don t measur progress toward that chang base on whether or not we cut more regul and how well ceo are do or give anoth 4 billion in tax break to the exxon mobil of the world
p5030
aVwe measur progress in america base on whether or not someon can pay their mortgag whether or not they can send their kid to colleg whether or not they re abl to when they send their child like we have abroad or i m about to abroad and john has as well i might add to fight that they are the best equip and they have everyth they need and when they come home they re guarante that they have the best health care and the best educ possibl
p5031
aVyou know in the neighborhood i grew up in it was all about digniti and respect a neighborhood like most of you grew up in and in that neighborhood it was fill with women and men mother and father who taught their children if they believ in themselv if they were honest if they work hard if they love their countri they could accomplish anyth we believ it and we did
p5032
aVthat s whi barack obama and i are run to re establish that certitud in our neighborhood
p5033
aVladi and gentlemen my dad use to have an express he d say champ when you get knock down get up
p5034
aVwell it s time for america to get up togeth america s readi you re readi i m readi and barack obama is readi to be the next presid of the unit state of america
p5035
aVmay god bless all of you and most of all for both of us selfish may god protect our troop
p5036
aVyes well you know until two week ago it was two monday ago john mccain said at 9 o clock in the morn that the fundament of the economi were strong two week befor that he said georg we ve made great econom progress under georg bush s polici
p5037
aVnine o clock the economi was strong eleven o clock that same day two monday ago john mccain said that we have an econom crisi
p5038
aVthat doesn t make john mccain a bad guy but it doe point out he s out of touch those folk on the sidelin knew that two month ago
p5039
aVjohn mccain in refer to the fundament of our economi be strong he was talk to and he was talk about the american workforc and the american workforc is the greatest in this world with the ingenu and the work ethic that is just entrench in our workforc that s a posit that s encourag and that s what john mccain meant
p5040
aVnow what i ve done as a governor and as a mayor is inaud i ve had that track record of reform and i ve join this team that is a team of maverick with john mccain also with his track record of reform where we re known for put partisan polit asid to just get the job done
p5041
aVnow barack obama of cours he s pretti much onli vote along his parti line in fact 96 percent of his vote have been sole along parti line not have that proof for the american peopl to know that his commit too is you know put the partisanship put the special interest asid and get down to get busi done for the peopl of america
p5042
aVwe re tire of the old polit as usual and that s whi with all due respect i do respect your year in the u s senat but i think american are crave someth new and differ and that new energi and that new commit that s go to come with reform
p5043
aVi think that s whi we need to send the maverick from the senat and put him in the white hous and i m happi to join him there
p5044
aVnice to meet you
p5045
aVdarn right it was the predat lender who tri to talk american into think that it was smart to buy a 300 000 hous if we could onli afford a 100 000 hous there was decept there and there was greed and there is corrupt on wall street and we need to stop that
p5046
aVagain john mccain and i that commit that we have made and we re go to follow through on that get rid of that corrupt
p5047
aVone thing that american do at this time also though is let s commit ourselv just everi day american peopl joe six pack hockey mom across the nation i think we need to band togeth and say never again never will we be exploit and taken advantag of again by those who are manag our money and loan us these dollar we need to make sure that we demand from the feder govern strict oversight of those entiti in charg of our invest and our save and we need also to not get ourselv in debt let s do what our parent told us befor we probabl even got that first credit card don t live outsid of our mean we need to make sure that as individu we re take person respons through all of this it s not the american peopl fault that the economi is hurt like it is but we have an opportun to learn a heck of a lot of good lesson through this and say never again will we be taken advantag of
p5048
aVwell gwen two year ago barack obama warn about the sub prime mortgag crisi john mccain said short after that in decemb he was surpris there was a sub prime mortgag problem john mccain while barack obama was warn about what we had to do was liter give an interview to the wall street journal say that i m alway for cut regul we let wall street run wild john mccain and he s a good man but john mccain thought the answer is that tri and true republican respons deregul deregul
p5049
aVit s a pleasur
p5050
aVso what you had is you had overwhelm deregul you had actual the belief that wall street could self regul itself and while barack obama was talk about reinstat those regul john on 20 differ occas in the previous year and a half call for more deregul as a matter of fact john recent wrote an articl in a major magazin say that he want to do for the health care industri deregul it and let the free market move like he did for the bank industri
p5051
aVso deregul was the promis and guess what those peopl who say don t go into debt they can bare pay to fill up their gas tank i was recent at my local gas station and ask a guy name joey danco ph i said joey how much did it cost to fill your tank you know what his answer was he said i don t know joe i never have enough money to do it the middl class need relief tax relief they need it now they need help now the focus will chang with barack obama
p5052
aVi would like to respond about the tax increas we can speak in agreement here that darn right we need tax relief for american so that job can be creat here now barack obama and senat biden also vote for the largest tax increas in u s histori barack had 94 opportun to side on the peopl s side and reduc tax and 94 time he vote to increas tax or not support a tax reduct 94 time
p5053
aVnow that s not what we need to creat job and realli bolster and heat up our economi we do need the privat sector to be abl to keep more of what we earn and produc govern is go to have to learn to be more effici and live with less if that s what it take to reign in the govern growth that we ve seen today but we do need tax relief and barack obama even support increas tax as late as last year for those famili make onli 42 000 a year that s a lot of middl incom averag american famili to increas tax on them i think that is the way to kill job and to continu to harm our economi
p5054
aVthe charg is absolut not true barack obama did not vote to rais tax the vote she s refer to john mccain vote the exact same way it was a budget procedur vote john mccain vote the same way it did not rais tax number two use the standard that the governor use john mccain vote 477 time to rais tax it s a bogus standard it but if you notic gwen the governor did not answer the question about deregul did not answer the question of defend john mccain about not go along with the deregul let wall street run wild he did support deregul almost across the board that s whi we got into so much troubl
p5055
aVi m still on the tax thing becaus i want to correct you on that again and i want to let you know what i did as a mayor and as a governor and i may not answer the question that either the moder or you want to hear but i m go to talk straight to the american peopl and let them know my track record also as mayor everi year i was in offic i did reduc tax i elimin person properti tax and elimin small busi inventori tax and as governor we suspend our state fuel tax we did all of those thing know that that is how our economi would be heat up now as for john mccain s adher to rule and regul and push for even harder and tougher regul that is anoth thing that he is known for though look at the tobacco industri look at campaign financ reform
p5056
aVhey can i call you joe
p5057
aVwell gwen where i come from it s call fair just simpl fair the middl class is struggl the middl class under john mccain s tax propos 100 million famili middl class famili household to be precis they got not a singl chang they got not a singl break in tax no one make less than 250 000 under barack obama s plan will see one singl penni of their tax rais whether it s their capit gain tax their incom tax invest tax ani tax and 95 percent of the peopl in the unit state of america make less than 150 000 will get a tax break
p5058
aVnow that seem to me to be simpl fair the econom engin of america is middl class it s the peopl listen to this broadcast when you do well america doe well even the wealthi do well this is not punit john want to add 300 million billion in new tax cut per year for corpor america and the veri wealthi while give virtual noth to the middl class we have a differ valu set the middl class is the econom engin it s fair they deserv the tax break not the super wealthi who are do pretti well they don t need ani more tax break and by the way they ll pay no more than they did under ronald reagan
p5059
aVi do take issu with some of the principl there with that redistribut of wealth principl that seem to be espous by you but when you talk about barack s plan to tax increas affect onli those make 250 000 a year or more you re forget million of small busi that are go to fit into that categori so they re go to be the one pay higher tax thus result in fewer job be creat and less product
p5060
aVnow you said recent that higher tax or ask for higher tax or pay higher tax is patriot in the middl class of america which is where todd and i have been all of our live that s not patriot patriot is say govern you know you re not alway the solut in fact too often you re the problem so govern lessen the tax burden and on our famili and get out of the way and let the privat sector and our famili grow and thrive and prosper an increas tax formula that barack obama is propos in addit to near a trillion dollar in new spend that he s propos is the backward way of tri to grow our economi
p5061
aVi am becaus he s got a good health care plan that is detail and i want to give you a coupl detail on that he s propos a 5 000 tax credit for famili so that they can get out there and they can purchas their own health care coverag that s a smart thing to do that s budget neutral that doesn t cost the govern anyth as oppos to barack obama s plan to mandat health care coverag and have univers govern run program and unless you re pleas with the way the feder govern has been run anyth late i don t think that it s go to be real pleas for american to consid health care be taken over by the fed but a 5 000 health care credit through our incom tax that s budget neutral that s go to help and he also want to eras those artifici line between state so that through competit we can cross state line and if there s a better plan offer somewher els we would be abl to purchas that so afford and access will be the key there with that 5 000 tax credit also be offer
p5062
aVgwen i don t know where to start we don t call a redistribut in my neighborhood scranton claymont wilmington the place i grew up to give the fair to say that not give exxon mobil anoth 4 billion tax cut this year as john call for and give it to middl class peopl to be abl to pay to get their kid to colleg we don t call that redistribut we call that fair number one number two fact 95 percent of the small busi in america their owner make less than 250 000 a year they would not get one singl solitari penni increas in tax those small busi
p5063
aVnow with regard to the to the health care plan you know it s with one hand you giveth the other you take it you know how barack obama excus me do you know how john mccain pay for his 5 000 tax credit you re go to get a famili will get
p5064
aVoff mike
p5065
aVhe tax as incom everi one of you out there everi one of you listen who has a health care plan through your employ that s how he rais 3 6 trillion on your tax your health care benefit to give you a 5 000 plan which his web site point out will go straight to the insur compani
p5066
aVand then you re go to have to replac a 12 000 that s the averag cost of the plan you get through your employ it cost 12 000 you re go to have to pay replac a 12 000 plan becaus 20 million of you are go to be drop twenti million of you will be drop
p5067
aVso you re go to have to place replac a 12 000 plan with a 5 000 check you just give to the insur compani i call that the ultim bridg to nowher
p5068
aVwell the one thing we might have to slow down is a commit we made to doubl foreign assist we ll probabl have to slow that down
p5069
aVwe also are go to make sure that we do not go forward with the tax cut propos of the administr of john mccain the exist one for peopl make over 250 000 which is 130 billion this year alon
p5070
aVthank you
p5071
aVwe re not go to support the 300 billion tax cut that they have for corpor america and the veri wealthi we re not go to support anoth 4 billion tax cut for exxonmobil
p5072
aVand what we re not go to also hold up on gwen is we cannot afford to hold up on provid for incent for new job by an energi polici creat new job
p5073
aVwe cannot slow up on educ becaus that s the engin that is go to give us the econom growth and competit that we need
p5074
aVand we are not go to slow up on the whole idea of provid for afford health care for american none of which when we get to talk about health care is as my as the governor character character
p5075
aVthe bottom line here is that we are go to in fact elimin those wast spend that exist in the budget right now a number of thing i don t have time becaus the light is blink that i won t be abl to mention but one of which is the 100 billion tax dodg that in fact allow peopl to take their post offic box off shore avoid tax
p5076
aVi call that unpatriot i call that unpatriot
p5077
aVthat s what i m talk about
p5078
aVwell the nice thing about run with john mccain is i can assur you he doesn t tell one thing to one group and then turn around and tell someth els to anoth group includ his plan that will make this bailout plan this rescu plan even better
p5079
aVwell theresa thank you and i can see whi you feel that cynic and mistrust becaus the system in washington is broken and i have been a consist reform
p5080
aVi have advoc and taken on the special interest whether they be the big money peopl by reach across the aisl and work with senat feingold on campaign financ reform whether it be a varieti of other issu work with senat lieberman on tri to address climat chang
p5081
aVi have a clear record of bipartisanship the situat today cri out for bipartisanship senat obama has never taken on his leader of his parti on a singl issu and we need to reform
p5082
aVand so let s look at our record as well as our rhetor that s realli part of your mistrust here and now i suggest that mayb you go to some of these organ that are the watchdog of what we do like the citizen against govern wast or the nation taxpay union or these other organ that watch us all the time
p5083
aVi don t expect you to watch everi vote and you know what you ll find this is the most liber big spend record in the unit state senat i have fought against excess spend and outrag i have fought to reduc the earmark and elimin them do you know that senat obama has vote for is propos 860 billion of new spend now new spend do you know that he vote for everi increas in spend that i saw come across the floor of the unit state senat while we were work to elimin these pork barrel earmark
p5084
aVhe vote for near a billion dollar in pork barrel earmark project includ by the way 3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in chicago illinoi my friend do we need to spend that kind of money
p5085
aVi think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his then you have to look at our propos for our economi not 860 billion in new spend but for the kind of reform that keep peopl in their job get middl incom american work again and get our economi move again
p5086
aVyou re go to be examin our propos tonight and in the futur and energi independ is a way to do that is one of them and drill offshor and nuclear power are two vital element of that and i ve been support those and i know how to fix this economi and elimin our depend on foreign oil and stop send 700 billion a year oversea
p5087
aVthe three prioriti were health
p5088
aVi think you can work on all three at onc tom i think it s veri import that reform our entitl program
p5089
aVmy friend we are not go to be abl to provid the same benefit for present day worker that we are go that present day retire have today we re go to have to sit down across the tabl republican and democrat as we did in 1983 between ronald reagan and tip o neill
p5090
aVi know how to do that i have a clear record of reach across the aisl whether it be joe lieberman or russ feingold or ted kennedi or other that s my clear record
p5091
aVwe can work on nuclear power plant build a whole bunch of them creat million of new job we have to have all of the abov altern fuel wind tide solar natur gas clean coal technolog all of these thing we can do as american and we can take on this mission and we can overcom it
p5092
aVmy friend some of this 700 billion end up in the hand of terrorist organ
p5093
aVas far as health care is concern obvious everyon is struggl to make sure that they can afford their premium and that they can have afford and avail health care that s the next issu
p5094
aVbut we can do them all at onc there s no and we have to do them all at onc all three you mention are compel nation secur requir
p5095
aVwe re go to have to priorit just like a famili has to priorit now i ve list the thing that i think have to be at the top of the list
p5096
aVenergi we have to deal with today becaus you re pay 3 80 here in nashvill for gasolin and it could go up and it s a strain on your famili budget but it s also bad for our nation secur becaus countri like russia and venezuela and you know in some case countri like iran are benefit from higher oil price
p5097
aVso we ve got to deal with that right away that s whi i ve call for an invest of 15 billion a year over 10 year our goal should be in 10 year s time we are free of depend on middl eastern oil
p5098
aVand we can do it now when jfk said we re go to the moon in 10 year nobodi was sure how to do it but we understood that if the american peopl make a decis to do someth it get done so that would be prioriti number one
p5099
aVhealth care is prioriti number two becaus that broken health care system is bad not onli for famili but it s make our busi less competit
p5100
aVand number three we ve got to deal with educ so that our young peopl are competit in a global economi
p5101
aVbut just one point i want to make tom senat mccain mention look at our record we do need to look at our record
p5102
aVsenat mccain like to talk about earmark a lot and that s import i want to go line by line through everi item in the feder budget and elimin program that don t work and make sure that those that do work work better and cheaper
p5103
aVbut understand this we also have to look at where some of our tax revenu are go so when senat mccain propos a 300 billion tax cut a continu not onli of the bush tax cut but an addit 200 billion that he s go to give to big corpor includ big oil compani 4 billion worth that s money out of the system
p5104
aVand so we ve got to priorit both our spend side and our tax polici to make sure that they re work for you that s what i m go to do as presid of the unit state
p5105
aVwell fiora i m go to ask the american peopl to understand that there are some program that we may have to elimin
p5106
aVi first propos a long time ago that we would have to examin everi agenc and everi bureaucraci of govern and we re go to have to elimin those that aren t work
p5107
aVi know a lot of them that aren t work one of them is in defens spend becaus i ve taken on some of the defens contractor i save the taxpay 6 8 billion in a deal for an air forc tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion
p5108
aVi believ that we have to elimin the earmark and sometim those project not not the overhead projector that senat obama ask for but some of them that are realli good project will have will have to be elimin as well
p5109
aVwell alan thank you veri much for the question i want to first obvious thank belmont univers tom thank you and to all of you who are particip tonight and those of you who sent e mail question in
p5110
aVand they ll have to undergo the same scrutini that all project should in competit with other
p5111
aVso we re go to have to tell the american peopl that spend is go to have to be cut in america and i recommend a spend freez that except for defens veteran affair and some other vital program we ll just have to have across the board freez
p5112
aVand some of those program may not grow as much as we would like for them to but we can establish prioriti with full transpar with full knowledg of the american peopl and full consult not done behind close door and shove earmark in the middl of the night into program that we don t even sometim we don t even know about until month later
p5113
aVand by the way i want to go back a second
p5114
aVlook we can attack health care and energi at the same time we re not we re not we re not rifl shot here we are american we can with the particip of all american work togeth and solv these problem togeth
p5115
aVfrank i m not go to tell that person without health insur that i m sorri you ll have to wait i m go to tell you american we ll get to work right away and we ll get to work togeth and we can get them all done becaus that s what america has been do
p5116
aVyou know a lot of you rememb the tragedi of 9 11 and where you were on that day and you know how all of the countri was readi to come togeth and make enorm chang to make us not onli safer but to make us a better countri and a more unifi countri
p5117
aVand presid bush did some smart thing at the outset but one of the opportun that was miss was when he spoke to the american peopl he said go out and shop
p5118
aVi think everybodi know now we are in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress and a lot of you i think are worri about your job your pension your retir account your abil to send your child or your grandchild to colleg
p5119
aVthat wasn t the kind of call to servic that i think the american peopl were look for
p5120
aVand so it s import to understand that the i think the american peopl are hungri for the kind of leadership that is go to tackl these problem not just in govern but outsid of govern
p5121
aVand let s take the exampl of energi which we alreadi spoke about there is go to be the need for each and everi one of us to start think about how we use energi
p5122
aVi believ in the need for increas oil product we re go to have to explor new way to get more oil and that includ offshor drill it includ tell the oil compani that current have 68 million acr that they re not use that either you use them or you lose them
p5123
aVwe re go to have to develop clean coal technolog and safe way to store nuclear energi
p5124
aVbut each and everi one of us can start think about how can we save energi in our home in our build and one of the thing i want to do is make sure that we re provid incent so that you can buy a fuel effici car that s made right here in the unit state of america not in japan or south korea make sure that you are abl to weather your home or make your busi more fuel effici
p5125
aVand that s go to requir effort from each and everi one of us
p5126
aVand the last point i just want to make i think the young peopl of america are especi interest in how they can serv and that s one of the reason whi i m interest in doubl the peac corp make sure that we are creat a volunt corp all across this countri that can be involv in their communiti involv in militari servic so that militari famili and our troop are not the onli one bear the burden of renew america
p5127
aVthat s someth that all of us have to be involv with and that requir some leadership from washington
p5128
aVand i believ this is a final verdict on the fail econom polici of the last eight year strong promot by presid bush and support by senat mccain that essenti said that we should strip away regul consum protect let the market run wild and prosper would rain down on all of us
p5129
aVwell i think it start with washington we ve got to show that we ve got good habit becaus if we re run up trillion dollar debt that we re pass on to the next generat then a lot of peopl are go to think well you know what there s easi money out there
p5130
aVit mean and i have to again repeat this it mean look at the spend side but also at the revenu side i mean senat mccain has been talk tough about earmark and that s good but earmark account for about 18 billion of our budget
p5131
aVnow when senat mccain is propos tax cut that would give the averag fortun 500 ceo an addit 700 000 in tax cut that s not share a burden
p5132
aVand so part of the problem i think for a lot of peopl who are listen here tonight is they don t feel as if they are share the burden with other folk
p5133
aVi mean you know it s tough to ask a teacher who s make 30 000 or 35 000 a year to tighten her belt when peopl who are make much more than her are live pretti high on the hog
p5134
aVand that s whi i think it s import for the presid to set a tone that say all of us are go to contribut all of us are go to make sacrific and it mean that yes we may have to cut some spend although i disagre with senat mccain about an across the board freez
p5135
aVthat s an exampl of an unfair burden share that s use a hatchet to cut the feder budget
p5136
aVi want to use a scalpel so that peopl who need help are get help and those of us like myself and senat mccain who don t need help aren t get it
p5137
aVit hasn t work out that way and so now we ve got to take some decis action
p5138
aVthat s how we make sure that everybodi is will to make a few sacrific
p5139
aVwell you know nail down senat obama s various tax propos is like nail jell o to the wall there has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough there will probabl be anoth one
p5140
aVbut he want to rais tax my friend the last presid to rais tax dure tough econom time was herbert hoover and he practic protection as well which i m sure we ll get to at some point
p5141
aVyou know last year up to this time we ve lost 700 000 job in america the onli bright spot is that over 300 000 job have been creat by small busi senat obama s secret that you don t know is that his tax increas will increas tax on 50 percent of small busi revenu
p5142
aVsmall busi across america will have to cut job and will have their tax increas and won t be abl to hire becaus of senat obama s tax polici you know he said some time ago he said he would forgo his tax increas if the economi was bad
p5143
aVi ve got some news senat obama the news is bad so let s not rais anybodi s tax my friend and make it be veri clear to you i am not in favor of tax cut for the wealthi i am in favor of leav the tax rate alon and reduc the tax burden on middl incom american by doubl your tax exempt for everi child from 3 500 to 7 000
p5144
aVto give everi american a 5 000 refund tax credit and go out and get the health insur you want rather than mandat and fine for small busi as senat obama s plan call for and let s creat job and let s get our economi go again and let s not rais anybodi s tax
p5145
aVtom can i respond to this briefli becaus
p5146
aVnow step one was a rescu packag that was pass last week we ve got to make sure that work proper and that mean strong oversight make sure that investor taxpay are get their money back and treat as investor
p5147
aVthe tax issu becaus i think it s veri import go ahead
p5148
aVwell tom we re go to have to take on entitl and i think we ve got to do it quick we re go to have a lot of work to do so i can t guarante that we re go to do it in the next two year but i d like to do in the my first term as presid
p5149
aVbut i think it s import to understand we re not go to solv social secur and medicar unless we understand the rest of our tax polici and you know senat mccain i think the straight talk express lost a wheel on that one
p5150
aVso let s be clear about my tax plan and senat mccain s becaus we re not go to be abl to deal with entitl unless we understand the revenu come in i want to provid a tax cut for 95 percent of american 95 percent
p5151
aVif you make less than a quarter of a million dollar a year you will not see a singl dime of your tax go up if you make 200 000 a year or less your tax will go down
p5152
aVnow senat mccain talk about small busi onli a few percent of small busi make more than 250 000 a year so the vast major of small busi would get a tax cut under my plan
p5153
aVand we provid a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insur for their worker becaus there are an aw lot of small busi that i meet across america that want to do right by their worker but they just can t afford it some small busi owner a lot of them can t even afford health insur for themselv
p5154
aVit mean that we are crack down on ceo and make sure that they re not get bonus or golden parachut as a consequ of this packag and in fact we just found out that aig a compani that got a bailout just a week after they got help went on a 400 000 junket
p5155
aVnow in contrast senat mccain want to give a 300 billion tax cut 200 billion of it to the largest corpor and a hundr thousand of it a hundr billion of it go to peopl like ceo on wall street he want to give averag fortun 500 ceo an addit 700 000 in tax cut that is not fair and it doesn t work
p5156
aVnow if we get our tax polici right so that they re good for the middl class if we revers the polici of the last eight year that got us into this fix in the first place and that senat mccain support then we are go to be in a posit to deal with social secur and deal with medicar becaus we will have a health care plan that actual work for you reduc spend and cost over the long term and social secur that is stabl and solvent for all american and not just some
p5157
aVsure hey i ll answer the question look look it s not that hard to fix social secur tom it s just
p5158
aVtough decis i want to get to medicar in a second
p5159
aVsocial secur is not that tough we know what the problem are my friend and we know what the fix are we ve got to sit down togeth across the tabl it s been done befor
p5160
aVi saw it done with our our wonder ronald reagan a conserv from california and the liber democrat tip o neill from massachusett that s what we need more of and that s what i ve done in washington
p5161
aVsenat obama has never taken on his parti leader on a singl major issu i ve taken them on i m not too popular sometim with my own parti much less his
p5162
aVso medicar it s go to be a littl tougher it s go to be a littl tougher becaus we re talk about veri complex and difficult issu
p5163
aVand i ll tell you what the treasuri should demand that money back and those execut should be fire but that s onli step one the middl class need a rescu packag and that mean tax cut for the middl class
p5164
aVmy friend what we have to do with medicar is have a commiss have the smartest peopl in america come togeth come up with recommend and then like the base close commiss idea we had then we should have congress vote up or down
p5165
aVlet s not let them fool with it anymor there s too much special interest and too mani lobbyist work there so let s have and let s have the american peopl say fix it for us now just back on this on this tax you know again it s back to our first question here about rhetor and record senat obama has vote 94 time to either increas your tax or against tax cut that s his record
p5166
aVwhen he ran for the unit state senat from illinoi he said he would have a middl incom tax cut you know he came to the senat and never onc propos legisl to do that
p5167
aVso let s look at our record i ve fought higher tax i have fought excess spend i have fought to reform govern
p5168
aVlet s look at our record my friend and then listen to my vision for the futur of america and we ll get our economi go again and our best day are ahead of us
p5169
aVwell thank you look we are in tough econom time we all know that and let s keep never forget the struggl that american are in today
p5170
aVit mean help for homeown so that they can stay in their home it mean that we are help state and local govern set up road project and bridg project that keep peopl in their job
p5171
aVbut when we can when we have an issu that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damag planet i have disagre strong with the bush administr on this issu i travel all over the world look at the effect of greenhous gas emiss joe lieberman and i
p5172
aVand i introduc the first legisl and we forc vote on it that s the good news my friend the bad news is we lost but we kept the debat go and we kept this issu to to pose to american the danger that climat chang oppos
p5173
aVnow how what s what s the best way of fix it nuclear power senat obama say that it has to be safe or dispos or someth like that
p5174
aVlook i i was on navi ship that had nuclear power plant nuclear power is safe and it s clean and it creat hundr of thousand of job
p5175
aVand and i know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel the japanes the british the french do it and we can do it too senat obama has oppos that we can move forward and clean up our climat and develop green technolog and altern altern energi for for hybrid for hydrogen for batteri power car so that we can clean up our environ and at the same time get our economi go by creat million of job
p5176
aVwe can do that we as american becaus we re the best innov we re the best produc and 95 percent of the peopl who are our market live outsid of the unit state of america
p5177
aVthis is one of the biggest challeng of our time
p5178
aVand it is absolut critic that we understand this is not just a challeng it s an opportun becaus if we creat a new energi economi we can creat five million new job easili here in the unit state
p5179
aVit can be an engin that drive us into the futur the same way the comput was the engin for econom growth over the last coupl of decad
p5180
aVand then long term we ve got to fix our health care system we ve got to fix our energi system that is put such an enorm burden on famili you need somebodi work for you and you ve got to have somebodi in washington who is think about the middl class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyist
p5181
aVand we can do it but we re go to have to make an invest the same way the comput was origin invent by a bunch of govern scientist who were tri to figur out for defens purpos how to communic we ve got to understand that this is a nation secur issu as well
p5182
aVand that s whi we ve got to make some invest and i ve call for invest in solar wind geotherm contrari to what senat mccain keep on say i favor nuclear power as one compon of our overal energi mix
p5183
aVbut this is anoth exampl where i think it is import to look at the record senat mccain and i actual agre on someth he said a while back that the big problem with energi is that for 30 year politician in washington haven t done anyth
p5184
aVwhat senat mccain doesn t mention is he s been there 26 of them and dure that time he vote 23 time against altern fuel 23 time
p5185
aVso it s easi to talk about this stuff dure a campaign but it s import for us to understand that it requir a sustain effort from the next presid
p5186
aVone last point i want to make on energi senat mccain talk a lot about drill and that s import but we have three percent of the world s oil reserv and we use 25 percent of the world s oil
p5187
aVso what that mean is that we can t simpli drill our way out of the problem and we re not go to be abl to deal with the climat crisi if our onli solut is to use more fossil fuel that creat global warm
p5188
aVwe re go to have to come up with altern and that mean that the unit state govern is work with the privat sector to fund the kind of innov that we can then export to countri like china that also need energi and are set up one coal power plant a week
p5189
aVwe ve got to make sure that we re give them the energi that they need or help them to creat the energi that they need
p5190
aVi m just tri to keep up with john
p5191
aVtom wave like that and i ll look at you
p5192
aVsure
p5193
aVi think pure research and develop invest on the part of the unit state govern is certain appropri i think onc it get into product stage that we ought to obvious turn it over to the privat sector
p5194
aVby the way my friend i know you grow a littl weari with this back and forth it was an energi bill on the floor of the senat load down with goodi billion for the oil compani and it was sponsor by bush and cheney
p5195
aVyou know who vote for it you might never know that one you know who vote against it me i have fought time after time against these pork barrel these bill that come to the floor and they have all kind of goodi and all kind of thing in them for everybodi and they buy off the vote
p5196
aVi vote against them my friend i vote against them but the point is also on oil drill oil drill offshor now is vital so that we can bridg the gap we can bridg the gap between import oil which is a nation secur issu as well as ani other and it will reduc the price of a barrel of oil becaus when peopl know there s a greater suppli then the cost of that will go down
p5197
aVwell thank you tom thank you belmont univers and senat obama it s good to be with you at a town hall meet
p5198
aVthat s fundament econom we ve got to drill offshor my friend and we ve got to do it now and we can do it
p5199
aVand as far as nuclear power is concern again look at the record senat obama has approv storag and reprocess of spent nuclear fuel
p5200
aVand i ll stop tom and you didn t even wave thank
p5201
aVwell you know as i travel around the countri this is one of the singl most frequent ask issu that i get is the issu of health care it is break famili budget i can t tell you how mani peopl i meet who don t have health insur
p5202
aVif you ve got health insur most of you have seen your premium doubl over the last eight year and your co payment and deduct have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alon if you re a small busi it s a crush burden
p5203
aVand alan thank you for your question you go to the heart of america s worri tonight american are angri they re upset and they re a littl fear it s our job to fix the problem
p5204
aVso one of the thing that i have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commit as well as an econom imper to do someth about the health care crisi that so mani famili are face
p5205
aVso here s what i would do if you ve got health care alreadi and probabl the major of you do then you can keep your plan if you are satisfi with it you can keep your choic of doctor we re go to work with your employ to lower the cost of your premium by up to 2 500 a year
p5206
aVand we re go to do it by invest in prevent we re go to do it by make sure that we use inform technolog so that medic record are actual on comput instead of you fill form out in triplic when you go to the hospit that will reduc medic error and reduc cost
p5207
aVif you don t have health insur you re go to be abl to buy the same kind of insur that senat mccain and i enjoy as feder employe becaus there s a huge pool we can drop the cost and nobodi will be exclud for pre exist condit which is a huge problem
p5208
aVnow senat mccain has a differ kind of approach he say that he s go to give you a 5 000 tax credit what he doesn t tell you is that he is go to tax your employ base health care benefit for the first time ever
p5209
aVso what one hand giveth the other hand taketh away he would also strip away the abil of state to provid some of the regul on insur compani to make sure you re not exclud for pre exist condit or your mammogram are cover or your matern is cover and that is fundament the wrong way to go
p5210
aVin fact just today busi organ like the unit state chamber of commerc which general are pretti support of republican said that this would lead to the unravel of the employ base health care system
p5211
aVthat i don t think is the kind of chang that we need we ve got to have somebodi who is fight for patient and make sure that you get decent afford health care and that s someth that i m commit to do as presid
p5212
aVwell thank you for the question you realli identifi one of the realli major challeng that america face co payment go up cost go up skyrocket cost which make peopl less and less abl to afford health insur in america
p5213
aVnow i have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energi independ we ve got to stop send 700 billion a year to countri that don t want us veri like us veri much we have to keep american tax low all american tax low let s not rais tax on anybodi today
p5214
aVand we need to do all of the thing that are necessari to make it more effici let s put health record onlin that will reduc medic error as they call them let s have communiti health center let s have walk in clinic let s do a lot of thing to impos effici
p5215
aVbut what is at stake here in this health care issu is the fundament differ between myself and senat obama as you notic he start talk about govern he start say govern will do this and govern will do that and then govern will and he ll impos mandat
p5216
aVif you re a small busi person and you don t insur your employe senat obama will fine you will fine you that s remark if you re a parent and you re struggl to get health insur for your children senat obama will fine you
p5217
aVi want to give everi american a 5 000 refund tax credit they can take it anywher across state line whi not don t we go across state line when we purchas other thing in america of cours it s ok to go across state line becaus in arizona they may offer a better plan that suit you best than it doe here in tennesse
p5218
aVand if you do the math those peopl who have employ base health benefit if you put the tax on it and you have what s left over and you add 5 000 that you re go to get as a refund tax credit do the math 95 percent of the american peopl will have increas fund to go out and buy the insur of their choic and to shop around and to get all of those peopl will be cover except for those who have these gold plate cadillac kind of polici
p5219
aVyou know like hair transplant i might need one of those myself but the point is that we have got to give peopl choic in america and not mandat thing on them and give them the abil everi parent i know would acquir health insur for their children if they could
p5220
aVobvious small busi peopl want to give their employe health insur of cours they all want to do that we ve got to give them the wherewith to do it we can do it by give them as a start a 5 000 refund tax credit to go around and get the health insur polici of their choic
p5221
aVi think it s a respons in this respect in that we should have avail and afford health care to everi american citizen to everi famili member and with the plan that that i have that will do that
p5222
aVwe obvious have to stop this spend spree that s go on in washington do you know that we ve laid a 10 trillion debt on these young american who are here with us tonight 500 billion of it we owe to china we ve got to have a packag of reform and it has got to lead to reform prosper and peac in the world and i think that this problem has becom so sever as you know that we re go to have to do someth about home valu
p5223
aVbut govern mandat i i m alway a littl nervous about but it is certain my respons it is certain small busi peopl and other and they understand that respons american citizen understand that employ understand that
p5224
aVbut they certain are a littl nervous when senat obama say if you don t get the health care polici that i think you should have then you re go to get fine and by the way senat obama has never mention how much that fine might be perhap we might find that out tonight
p5225
aVwell whi don t whi don t let s talk about this tom becaus there was just a lot of stuff out there
p5226
aVwell i think it should be a right for everi american in a countri as wealthi as our for us to have peopl who are go bankrupt becaus they can t pay their medic bill for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last month of her life in the hospit room argu with insur compani becaus they re say that this may be a pre exist condit and they don t have to pay her treatment there s someth fundament wrong about that
p5227
aVso let me let me just talk about this fundament differ and tom i know that we re under time constraint but senat mccain through a lot of stuff out there
p5228
aVnumber one let me just repeat if you ve got a health care plan that you like you can keep it all i m go to do is help you to lower the premium on it you ll still have choic of doctor there s no mandat involv
p5229
aVsmall busi are not go to have a mandat what we re go to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provid health care for those that you need
p5230
aVnow it s true that i say that you are go to have to make sure that your child has health care becaus children are relat cheap to insur and we don t want them go to the emerg room for treatabl ill like asthma
p5231
aVand when senat mccain say that he want to provid children health care what he doesn t mention is he vote against the expans of the children s health insur program that is respons for make sure that so mani children who didn t have previous health insur have it now
p5232
aVyou know that home valu of retire continu to declin and peopl are no longer abl to afford their mortgag payment as presid of the unit state alan i would order the secretari of the treasuri to immedi buy up the bad home loan mortgag in america and renegoti at the new valu of those home at the diminish valu of those home and let peopl be abl to make those be abl to make those payment and stay in their home
p5233
aVnow the final point i ll make on this whole issu of govern intrus and mandat it is absolut true that i think it is import for govern to crack down on insur compani that are cheat their custom that don t give you the fine print so you end up think that you re pay for someth and when you final get sick and you need it you re not get it
p5234
aVand the reason that it s a problem to go shop state by state you know what insur compani will do they will find a state mayb arizona mayb anoth state where there are no requir for you to get cancer screen where there are no requir for you to have to get pre exist condit and they will all set up shop there
p5235
aVthat s how in bank it work everybodi goe to delawar becaus they ve got veri pretti loos law when it come to thing like credit card
p5236
aVand in that situat what happen is is that the protect you have the consum protect that you need you re not go to have avail to you
p5237
aVthat is a fundament differ that i have with senat mccain he believ in deregul in everi circumst that s what we ve been go through for the last eight year it hasn t work and we need fundament chang
p5238
aVi don t believ that did we hear the size of the fine
p5239
aVis it expens yes but we all know my friend until we stabil home valu in america we re never go to start turn around and creat job and fix our economi and we ve got to give some trust and confid back to america
p5240
aVwell i thank you for that question becaus there s no doubt that histori show us that nation that are strong militarili over time have to have a strong economi as well and that is one of the challeng that america face
p5241
aVbut have said that america and we ll hear a lot of critic i ve heard a lot of critic about america and our nation secur polici and all that and much of that critic is justifi
p5242
aVbut the fact is america is the greatest forc for good in the histori of the world my friend we have gone to all four corner of the earth and shed american blood in defens usual of somebodi els s freedom and our own
p5243
aVso we are peacemak and we re peacekeep but the challeng is to know when the unit state of american can benefici effect the outcom of a crisi when to go in and when not when american militari power is worth the expenditur of our most precious treasur
p5244
aVand that question can onli be answer by someon with the knowledg and experi and the judgment the judgment to know when our nation secur is not onli at risk but where the unit state of america can make a differ in prevent genocid in prevent the spread of terror in do the thing that the unit state has done not alway well but we ve done becaus we re a nation of good
p5245
aVand i am convinc that my record go back to my opposit from send the marin to lebanon to support our effort in kosovo and bosnia and the first gulf war and my judgment i think is someth that i m a record that i m will to stand on
p5246
aVsenat obama was wrong about iraq and the surg he was wrong about russia when they commit aggress against georgia and in his short career he doe not understand our nation secur challeng
p5247
aVwe don t have time for on the job train my friend
p5248
aVwell you know senat mccain in the last debat and today again suggest that i don t understand it s true there are some thing i don t understand
p5249
aVi know how the do that my friend and it s my propos it s not senat obama s propos it s not presid bush s propos but i know how to get america work again restor our economi and take care of work american thank you
p5250
aVi don t understand how we end up invad a countri that had noth to do with 9 11 while osama bin laden and al qaeda are set up base camp and safe haven to train terrorist to attack us
p5251
aVthat was senat mccain s judgment and it was the wrong judgment
p5252
aVwhen senat mccain was cheerlead the presid to go into iraq he suggest it was go to be quick and easi we d be greet as liber
p5253
aVthat was the wrong judgment and it s been cost to us so one of the difficulti with iraq is that it has put an enorm strain first of all on our troop obvious and they have perform heroic and honor and we owe them an extraordinari debt of gratitud
p5254
aVbut it s also put an enorm strain on our budget we ve spent so far close to 700 billion and if we continu on the path that we re on as senat mccain is suggest it s go to go well over 1 trillion
p5255
aVwe re spend 10 billion a month in iraq at a time when the iraqi have a 79 billion surplus 79 billion
p5256
aVand we need that 10 billion a month here in the unit state to put peopl back to work to do all these wonder thing that senat mccain suggest we should be do but has not yet explain how he would pay for
p5257
aVnow senat mccain and i do agre this is the greatest nation on earth we are a forc of good in the world but there has never been a nation in the histori of the world that saw it economi declin and maintain it militari superior
p5258
aVand the strain that have been place on our allianc around the world and the respect that s been diminish over the last eight year has constrain us be abl to act on someth like the genocid in darfur becaus we don t have the resourc or the alli to do everyth that we should be do
p5259
aVthat s go to chang when i m presid but we can t chang it unless we fundament chang senat mccain s and georg bush s foreign polici it has not work for america
p5260
aVwell we may not alway have nation secur issu at stake but we have moral issu at stake
p5261
aVif we could have interven effect in the holocaust who among us would say that we had a moral oblig not to go in
p5262
aVif we could ve stop rwanda sure if we had the abil that would be someth that we would have to strong consid and act
p5263
aVso when genocid is happen when ethnic cleans is happen somewher around the world and we stand idl by that diminish us
p5264
aVand so i do believ that we have to consid it as part of our interest our nation interest in interven where possibl
p5265
aVbut understand that there s a lot of cruelti around the world we re not go to be abl to be everywher all the time that s whi it s so import for us to be abl to work in concert with our alli
p5266
aVlet s take the exampl of darfur just for a moment right now there s a peacekeep forc that has been set up and we have african union troop in darfur to stop a genocid that has kill hundr of thousand of peopl
p5267
aVwe could be provid logist support set up a no fli zone at relat littl cost to us but we can onli do it if we can help mobil the intern communiti and lead and that s what i intend to do when i m presid
p5268
aVwell let me just follow up my friend if we had done what senat obama want done in iraq and that was set a date for withdraw which general petraeus our chief chairman of our joint chief of staff said would be a veri danger cours to take for america then we would have had a wider war we would have been back iranian influenc would have increas al qaeda would have re establish a base
p5269
aVthere was a lot at stake there my friend and i can tell you right now that senat obama would have brought our troop home in defeat i ll bring them home with victori and with honor and that is a fundament differ
p5270
aVthe unit state of america tom is the greatest forc for good as i said and we must do whatev we can to prevent genocid whatev we can to prevent these terribl calam that we have said never again
p5271
aVbut it also has to be temper with our abil to benefici affect the situat that requir a cool hand at the tiller this requir a person who understand what our the limit of our capabl are
p5272
aVwe went in to somalia as a peacemak organ we end up tri to be excus me as a peacekeep organ we end up tri to be peacemak and we end up have to withdraw in humili
p5273
aVin lebanon i stood up to presid reagan my hero and said if we send marin in there how can we possibl benefici affect this situat and said we shouldn t unfortun almost 300 brave young marin were kill
p5274
aVso you have to temper your decis with the abil to benefici affect the situat and realiz you re send america s most precious asset american blood into harm s way and again i know those situat
p5275
aVi ve been in them all my life and i can tell you right now the secur of your young men and women who are serv in the militari are my first prioriti right after our nation s secur
p5276
aVnot you tom
p5277
aVand i may have to make those tough decis but i won t take them light and i understand that we have to say never again to a holocaust and never again to rwanda but we had also better be darn sure we don t leav and make the situat wors therebi exacerb our reput and our abil to address crise in other part of the world
p5278
aVkati it s a terrif question and we have a difficult situat in pakistan i believ that part of the reason we have a difficult situat is becaus we made a bad judgment go into iraq in the first place when we hadn t finish the job of hunt down bin laden and crush al qaeda
p5279
aVso what happen was we got distract we divert resourc and ultim bin laden escap set up base camp in the mountain of pakistan in the northwest provinc there
p5280
aVthey are now raid our troop in afghanistan destabil the situat they re stronger now than at ani time sinc 2001 and that s whi i think it s so import for us to revers cours becaus that s the central front on terror
p5281
aVthey are plot to kill american right now as secretari gate the defens secretari said the war against terror began in that region and that s where it will end so part of the reason i think it s so import for us to end the war in iraq is to be abl to get more troop into afghanistan put more pressur on the afghan govern to do what it need to do elimin some of the drug traffick that s fund terror
p5282
aVbut i do believ that we have to chang our polici with pakistan we can t coddl as we did a dictat give him billion of dollar and then he s make peac treati with the taliban and milit
p5283
aVwhat i ve said is we re go to encourag democraci in pakistan expand our nonmilitari aid to pakistan so that they have more of a stake in work with us but insist that they go after these milit
p5284
ag657
aVand if we have osama bin laden in our sight and the pakistani govern is unabl or unwil to take them out then i think that we have to act and we will take them out we will kill bin laden we will crush al qaida that has to be our biggest nation secur prioriti
p5285
aVwell kati thank you
p5286
aVyou know my hero is a guy name teddi roosevelt teddi roosevelt use to say walk soft talk soft but carri a big stick senat obama like to talk loud
p5287
aVin fact he said he want to announc that he s go to attack pakistan remark
p5288
aVyou know if you are a countri and you re tri to gain the support of anoth countri then you want to do everyth you can that they would act in a cooper fashion
p5289
aVwhen you announc that you re go to launch an attack into anoth countri it s pretti obvious that you have the effect that it had in pakistan it turn public opinion against us
p5290
aVnow let me just go back with you veri briefli we drove the russian out with the afghan freedom fighter drove the russian out of afghanistan and then we made a most serious mistak we wash our hand of afghanistan the taliban came back in al qaida we then had the situat that requir us to conduct the afghan war
p5291
aVnow our relat with pakistan are critic becaus the border area are be use as safe haven by the taliban and al qaida and other extremist organ and we have to get their support
p5292
aVnow general petraeus had a strategi the same strategi veri veri differ becaus of the condit and the situat but the same fundament strategi that succeed in iraq and that is to get the support of the peopl
p5293
aVwe need to help the pakistani govern go into waziristan where i visit a veri rough countri and and get the support of the peopl and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel taliban and other
p5294
aVand by work and coordin our effort togeth not threaten to attack them but work with them and where necessari use forc but talk soft but carri a big stick
p5295
aVtom just a
p5296
aVjust a quick follow up on this i think
p5297
aVif we re go to have follow up then i will want follow up as well
p5298
aVit d be fine with me it d be fine with me
p5299
aVthen let s have one
p5300
aVyou know that s a tough question and there s a lot of qualifi american but i think the first criteria tom would have to be somebodi who immedi american identifi with immedi say we can trust that individu
p5301
aVit d be fine with me
p5302
aVjust just just a quick follow up becaus i think i think this is import
p5303
aVyou re do a great job tom
p5304
aVlook i i want to be veri clear about what i said nobodi call for the invas of pakistan senat mccain continu to repeat this
p5305
aVwhat i said was the same thing that the audienc here today heard me say which is if pakistan is unabl or unwil to hunt down bin laden and take him out then we should
p5306
aVnow that i think has to be our polici becaus they are threaten to kill more american
p5307
aVnow senat mccain suggest that somehow you know i m green behind the ear and you know i m just spout off and he s somber and respons
p5308
aVa support of senat obama s is warren buffett he has alreadi weigh in and help stabil some of the difficulti in the market and with compani and corpor institut today
p5309
aVthank you veri much
p5310
aVsenat mccain this is the guy who sang bomb bomb bomb iran who call for the annihil of north korea that i don t think is an exampl of speak soft
p5311
aVthis is the person who after we had we hadn t even finish afghanistan where he said next up baghdad
p5312
aVso i agre that we have to speak respons and we have to act respons and the reason pakistan the popular opinion of america had diminish in pakistan was becaus we were support a dictat musharraf had given him 10 billion over seven year and he had suspend civil liberti we were not promot democraci
p5313
aVthis is the kind of polici that ultim end up undermin our abil to fight the war on terror and it will chang when i m presid
p5314
aVand tom if if we re go to go back and forth i then i d like to have equal time to go to respond to
p5315
aVto to to
p5316
aVnot true not true i have obvious support those effort that the unit state had to go in militarili and i have oppos that i didn t think so
p5317
aVi like meg whitman she know what it s like to be out there in the marketplac she know how to creat job meg whitman was ceo of a compani that start with 12 peopl and is now 1 3 million peopl in america make their live off ebay mayb somebodi here has done a littl busi with them
p5318
aVi understand what it s like to send young american s in harm s way i say i was joke with a veteran i hate to even go into this i was joke with an old veteran friend who joke with me about iran
p5319
aVbut the point is that i know how to handl these crise and senat obama by say that he would attack pakistan look at the context of his word i ll get osama bin laden my friend i ll get him i know how to get him
p5320
aVi ll get him no matter what and i know how to do it but i m not go to telegraph my punch which is what senat obama did and i m go to act respons as i have act respons throughout my militari career and throughout my career in the unit state senat
p5321
aVand we have fundament disagr about the use of militari power and how you do it and you just saw it in respons to previous question
p5322
aVi ll be veri brief we are go to have to make the iraqi govern start take more respons withdraw our troop in a respons way over time becaus we re go to have to put some addit troop in afghanistan
p5323
aVgeneral mckiernan the command in afghanistan right now is desper for more help becaus our base and outpost are now target for more aggress afghan taliban offens we re also go to have to work with the karzai govern and when i met with presid karzai i was veri clear that you are go to have to do better by your peopl in order for us to gain the popular support that s necessari
p5324
aVi don t think he has to be a dictat and we want a democraci in afghanistan but we have to have a govern that is respons to the afghan peopl and frank it s just not respons right now
p5325
aVbut the point is it s go to have to be somebodi who inspir trust and confid becaus the problem in america today to a larg extent tom is that we don t have trust and confid in our institut becaus of the corrupt on wall street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in washington d c
p5326
aVgeneral petraeus has just taken over a posit of respons where he has the command and will realli set the tone for the strategi and tactic that are use
p5327
aVand i ve had convers with him it is the same overal strategi of cours we have to do some thing tactic some of which senat obama is correct on
p5328
aVwe have to doubl the size of the afghan armi we have to have a streamlin nato command structur we have to do a lot of thing we have to work much more close with the pakistani
p5329
aVbut most import we have to have the same strategi which senat obama said wouldn t work couldn t work still fail to admit that he was wrong about iraq
p5330
aVhe still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategi of the surg in iraq and that s the same kind of strategi of go out and secur and hold and allow peopl to live normal live
p5331
aVand onc they feel secur then they lead normal social econom polit live the same thing that s happen in iraq today
p5332
aVso i have confid that general petraeus work with the pakistani work with the afghan do the same job that he did in iraq will again we will succeed and we will bring our troop home with honor and victori and not in defeat
p5333
aVfirst of all as i say i don t think that we re not go to have anoth cold war with russia
p5334
aVbut have no doubt that russia s behavior is certain outsid the norm of behavior that we would expect for nation which are veri wealthi as russia has becom becaus of their petro dollar
p5335
aVnow long ago i warn about vladimir putin i said i look into his eye and saw three letter a k a g and a b he has surround himself with former kgb apparatchik he has gradual repress most of the liberti that we would expect for nation to observ and he has exhibit most aggress behavior obvious in georgia
p5336
aVi said befor watch ukrain ukrain right now is in the sight of vladimir putin those that want to reassembl the old soviet union
p5337
aVwe ve got to show moral support for georgia
p5338
aVwe ve got to show moral support for ukrain we ve got to advoc for their membership in nato
p5339
aVwe have to make the russian understand that there are penalti for these this kind of behavior this kind of nake aggress into georgia a tini countri and a tini democraci
p5340
aVand so of cours we want to bring intern pressur to bear on russia in hope that that will modifi and eventu chang their behavior now the g 8 is one of those but there are mani other
p5341
aVbut the russian must understand that these kind of action and activ are not accept and hope we will use the leverag econom diplomat and other unit with our alli with our alli and friend in europ who are equal disturb as we are about their recent behavior
p5342
aVwell warren would be a pretti good choic warren buffett and i m pleas to have his support but there are other folk out there the key is make sure that the next treasuri secretari understand that it s not enough just to help those at the top
p5343
aVit will not be a re ignit of the cold war but russia is a challeng
p5344
aVwell the resurg of russia is one of the central issu that we re go to have to deal with in the next presid and for the most part i agre with senat mccain on mani of the step that have to be taken
p5345
aVbut we can t just provid moral support we ve got to provid moral support to the pole and estonia and latvia and all of the nation that were former soviet satellit but we ve also got to provid them with financi and concret assist to help rebuild their economi georgia in particular is now on the brink of enorm econom challeng and some say that that s what putin intend in the first place
p5346
aVthe other thing we have to do though is we ve got to see around the corner we ve got to anticip some of these problem ahead of time you know back in april i put out a statement say that the situat in georgia was unsustain becaus you had russian peacekeep in these territori that were under disput
p5347
aVand you knew that if the russian themselv were tri to obtain some of these territori or push back against georgia that that was not a stabl situat so part of the job of the next command in chief in keep all of you safe is make sure that we can see some of the 21st centuri challeng and anticip them befor they happen
p5348
aVwe haven t been do enough of that we tend to be reactiv that s what we ve been do over the last eight year and that has actual made us more safe that s part of what happen in afghanistan where we rush into iraq and senat mccain and presid bush suggest that it wasn t that import to catch bin laden right now and that we could muddl through and that has cost us dear
p5349
aVwe ve got to be much more strateg if we re go to be abl to deal with all of the challeng that we face out there
p5350
aVand one last point i want to make about russia energi is go to be key in deal with russia if we can reduc our energi consumpt that reduc the amount of petro dollar that they have to make mischief around the world that will strengthen us and weaken them when it come to issu like georgia
p5351
aVprosper is not just go to trickl down we ve got to help the middl class
p5352
aVi think they ve engag in an evil behavior and i think that it is import that we understand they re not the old soviet union but they still have nationalist impuls that i think are veri danger
p5353
aVmayb
p5354
ag657
aVdepend on how we respond to russia and it depend on a lot of thing if i say yes then that mean that we re reignit the old cold war if i say no it ignor their behavior
p5355
aVobvious energi is go to be a big big factor and georgia and ukrain are both major gateway of energi into europ and that s one of the reason whi it s in our interest
p5356
aVbut the russian i think we can deal with them but they ve got to understand that they re face a veri firm and determin unit state of america that will defend our interest and that of other countri in the world
p5357
aVand we ve you know senat mccain and i have some fundament disagr on the economi start with senat mccain s statement earlier that he thought the fundament of the economi were sound
p5358
aVwell thank you terri and thank you for your servic to the countri
p5359
aVi want to say everyth i ever learn about leadership i learn from a chief petti offic and i thank you and i thank you my friend thank for serv
p5360
aVlet let let me say that we obvious would not wait for the unit nation secur council i think the realiti are that both russia and china would probabl pose signific obstacl
p5361
aVand our challeng right now is the iranian continu on the path to acquir nuclear weapon and it s a great threat it s not just a threat threat to the state of israel it s a threat to the stabil of the entir middl east
p5362
aVif iran acquir nuclear weapon all the other countri will acquir them too the tension will be ratchet up
p5363
aVwhat would you do if you were the isra and the presid of a countri say that they are they are determin to wipe you off the map call your countri a stink corps
p5364
aVnow senat obama without precondit want to sit down and negoti with them without precondit that s what he state again a matter of record
p5365
aVi want to make sure that the iranian are put enough that we put enough pressur on the iranian by join with our alli impos signific tough sanction to modifi their behavior and i think we can do that
p5366
aVi think join with our alli and friend in a leagu of democraci that we can effect abridg their behavior and hope they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapon
p5367
aVbut at the end of the day my friend i have to tell you again and you know what it s like to serv and you know what it s like to sacrific but we can never allow a second holocaust to take place
p5368
aVpart of the problem here is that for mani of you wage and incom have flat line for mani of you it is get harder and harder to save harder and harder to retir
p5369
aVwell terri first of all we honor your servic and we re grate for it
p5370
aVwe cannot allow iran to get a nuclear weapon it would be a game changer in the region not onli would it threaten israel our strongest alli in the region and one of our strongest alli in the world but it would also creat a possibl of nuclear weapon fall into the hand of terrorist
p5371
aVand so it s unaccept and i will do everyth that s requir to prevent it
p5372
aVand we will never take militari option off the tabl and it is import that we don t provid veto power to the unit nation or anyon els in act in our interest
p5373
aVit is import though for us to use all the tool at our dispos to prevent the scenario where we ve got to make those kind of choic
p5374
aVand that s whi i have consist said that if we can work more effect with other countri diplomat to tighten sanction on iran if we can reduc our energi consumpt through altern energi so that iran has less money if we can impos the kind of sanction that say for exampl iran right now import gasolin even though it s an oil produc becaus it oil infrastructur has broken down if we can prevent them from import the gasolin that they need and the refin petroleum product that start chang their cost benefit analysi that start put the squeez on them
p5375
aVnow it is true though that i believ that we should have direct talk not just with our friend but also with our enemi to deliv a tough direct messag to iran that if you don t chang your behavior then there will be dire consequ
p5376
aVif you do chang your behavior then it is possibl for you to re join the communiti of nation
p5377
aVnow it may not work but one of the thing we ve learn is is that when we take that approach whether it s in north korea or in iran then we have a better chanc at better outcom
p5378
aVand that s whi for exampl on tax polici what i want to do is provid a middl class tax cut to 95 percent of work american those who are work two job peopl who are not spend enough time with their kid becaus they are struggl to make end meet
p5379
aVwhen presid bush decid we re not go to talk to iran we re not go to talk to north korea you know what happen iran went from zero centrifug to develop nuclear weapon to 4 000 north korea quadrupl it nuclear capabl
p5380
aVwe ve got to tri to have talk understand that we re not take militari option off the tabl
p5381
aVmy wife michell is there and she could give you a much longer list than i do and most of the time i learn it by ask her
p5382
aVbut look the natur of the challeng that we re go to face are immens and one of the thing that we know about the presid is that it s never the challeng that you expect it s the challeng that you don t that end up consum most of your time
p5383
aVbut here s what i do know i know that i wouldn t be stand here if it weren t for the fact that this countri gave me opportun i came from veri modest mean i had a singl mom and my grandpar rais me and it was becaus of the help of scholarship and my grandmoth scrimp on thing that she might have want to purchas and my mom at one point get food stamp in order for us to put food on the tabl
p5384
aVsenat mccain is right that we ve got to stabil hous price but under that is loss of job and loss of incom that s someth that the next treasuri secretari is go to have to work on
p5385
aVdespit all that i was abl to go to the best school on earth and i was abl to succeed in a way that i could not have succeed anywher els in this countri
p5386
aVthe same is true for michell and i m sure the same is true for a lot of you
p5387
aVand the question in this elect is are we go to pass on that same american dream to the next generat over the last eight year we ve seen that dream diminish
p5388
aVwage and incom have gone down peopl have lost their health care or are go bankrupt becaus they get sick we ve got young peopl who have got the grade and the will and the drive to go to colleg but they just don t have the money
p5389
aVand we can t expect that if we do the same thing that we ve been do over the last eight year that somehow we are go to have a differ outcom
p5390
aVwe need fundament chang that s what s at stake in this elect that s the reason i decid to run for presid and i m hope that all of you are prepar to continu this extraordinari journey that we call america

p5392
aVthank you brokaw senat mccain you get the last word senat obama had the open you re last up
p5393
aVwell thank you tom and i think what i don t know is what all of us don t know and that s what s go to happen both here at home and abroad
p5394
aVthe challeng that we face are unpreced american are hurt tonight in a way they have not in our generat
p5395
aVthere are challeng around the world that are new and differ and there will be differ we will be talk about countri sometim in the futur that we hard know where they are on the map some american
p5396
aVso what i don t know is what the unexpect will be but i have spent my whole life serv this countri i grew up in a famili where my father was gone most of the time becaus he was at sea and do our countri s busi my mother basic rais our famili
p5397
aVi know what it s like in dark time i know what it s like to have to fight to keep one s hope go through difficult time i know what it s like to reli on other for support and courag and love in tough time
p5398
aVi know what it s like to have your comrad reach out to you and your neighbor and your fellow citizen and pick you up and put you back in the fight
p5399
aVthat s what america s all about i believ in this countri i believ in it futur i believ in it great it s been my great honor to serv it for mani mani year
p5400
aVand i m ask the american peopl to give me anoth opportun and i ll rest on my record but i ll also tell you when time are tough we need a steadi hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to alway put my countri first
p5401
aVthank you tom
p5402
aVwell thank you oliv and that s an excel question becaus as you just describ it bailout when i believ that it s rescu becaus becaus of the greed and excess in washington and wall street main street was pay a veri heavi price and we know that
p5403
aVi left my campaign and suspend it to go back to washington to make sure that there were addit protect for the taxpay in the form of good oversight in the form of taxpay be the first to be paid back when our economi recov and it will recov and a number of other measur
p5404
aVbut you know one of the real catalyst realli the match that lit this fire was fanni mae and freddi mac i ll bet you you may never even have heard of them befor this crisi
p5405
aVbut you know they re the one that with the encourag of senat obama and his croni and his friend in washington that went out and made all these riski loan gave them to peopl that could never afford to pay back
p5406
aVand you know there were some of us that stood up two year ago and said we ve got to enact legisl to fix this we ve got to stop this greed and excess
p5407
aVmeanwhil the democrat in the senat and some and some member of congress defend what fanni and freddi were do they resist ani chang
p5408
aVmeanwhil they were get all kind of money in campaign contribut senat obama was the second highest recipi of fanni mae and freddi mac money in histori in histori
p5409
aVso this rescu packag mean that we will stabil market we will shore up these institut but it s not enough that s whi we re go to have to go out into the hous market and we re go to have to buy up these bad loan and we re go to have to stabil home valu and that way american like alan can realiz the american dream and stay in their home
p5410
aVbut fanni and freddi were the catalyst the match that start this forest fire there were some of us there were some of us that stood up against it there were other who took a hike
p5411
aVwell oliv first let me tell you what s in the rescu packag for you right now the credit market are frozen up and what that mean as a practic matter is that small busi and some larg busi just can t get loan
p5412
aVif they can t get a loan that mean that they can t make payrol if they can t make payrol then they may end up have to shut their door and lay peopl off
p5413
aVand if you imagin just one compani tri to deal with that now imagin a million compani all across the countri
p5414
aVso it could end up have an advers effect on everybodi and that s whi we had to take action but we shouldn t have been there in the first place
p5415
aVnow i ve got to correct a littl bit of senat mccain s histori not surpris let s first of all understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregul of the financi system senat mccain as recent as march brag about the fact that he is a deregul on the other hand two year ago i said that we ve got a sub prime lend crisi that has to be dealt with
p5416
aVi wrote to secretari paulson i wrote to feder reserv chairman bernank and told them this is someth we have to deal with and nobodi did anyth about it
p5417
aVa year ago i went to wall street and said we ve got to reregul and noth happen
p5418
aVand senat mccain dure that period said that we should keep on deregul becaus that s how the free enterpris system work
p5419
aVnow with respect to fanni mae what senat mccain didn t mention is the fact that this bill that he talk about wasn t his own bill he jump on it a year after it had been introduc and it never got pass
p5420
aVand i never promot fanni mae in fact senat mccain s campaign chairman s firm was a lobbyist on behalf of fanni mae not me
p5421
aVso but look you re not interest in hear politician point finger what you re interest in is tri to figur out how is this go to impact you
p5422
aVthis is not the end of the process this is the begin of the process and that s whi it s go to be so import for us to work with homeown to make sure that they can stay in their home
p5423
aVthe secretari alreadi has the power to do that in the rescu packag but it hasn t been exercis yet and the next presid has to make sure that the next treasuri secretari is think about how to strengthen you as a home buyer you as a homeown and not simpli think about bail out bank on wall street
p5424
aVno i am confid about the american economi but we are go to have to have some leadership from washington that not onli set out much better regul for the financi system
p5425
aVthe problem is we still have a archaic 20th centuri regulatori system for 21st centuri financi market we re go to have to coordin with other countri to make sure that whatev action we take work
p5426
aVbut most import we re go to have to help ordinari famili be abl to stay in their home make sure that they can pay their bill deal with critic issu like health care and energi and we re go to have to chang the cultur in washington so that lobbyist and special interest aren t drive the process and your voic aren t be drown out
p5427
aVi think it depend on what we do i think if we act effect if we stabil the hous market which i believ we can if we go out and buy up these bad loan so that peopl can have a new mortgag at the new valu of their home i think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influenc in washington so we can act more effect
p5428
aVmy friend i d like you to see the letter that a group of senat and i wrote warn exact of this crisi senat obama s name was not on that letter
p5429
aVthe point is the point is that we can fix our economi american worker are the best in the world they re the fundament aspect of america s economi
p5430
aVthey re the most innov they re the best they re most have best we re the best export we re the best import they re most effect they are the best worker in the world
p5431
aVand we ve got to give them a chanc they ve got we ve got to give them a chanc to do their best again and they are the innoc bystand here in what is the biggest financi crisi and challeng of our time we can do it
p5432
aVwell look i understand your frustrat and your cynic becaus while you ve been carri out your respons most of the peopl here you ve got a famili budget if less money is come in you end up make cut mayb you don t go out to dinner as much mayb you put off buy a new car
p5433
aVthat s not what happen in washington and you re right there is a lot of blame to go around
p5434
aVbut i think it s import just to rememb a littl bit of histori when georg bush came into offic we had surplus and now we have half a trillion dollar deficit annual
p5435
aVwhen georg bush came into offic our debt nation debt was around 5 trillion it s now over 10 trillion we ve almost doubl it and so while it s true that nobodi s complet innoc here we have had over the last eight year the biggest increas in deficit spend and nation debt in our histori and senat mccain vote for four out of five of those georg bush budget
p5436
aVso here s what i would do i m go to spend some money on the key issu that we ve got to work on
p5437
aVyou know you may have seen your health care premium go up we ve got to reform health care to help you and your budget
p5438
aVwe are go to have to deal with energi becaus we can t keep on borrow from the chines and send money to saudi arabia we are mortgag our children s futur we ve got to have a differ energi plan
p5439
aVwe ve got to invest in colleg afford so we re go to have to make some invest but we ve also got to make spend cut and what i ve propos you ll hear senat mccain say well he s propos a whole bunch of new spend but actual i m cut more than i m spend so that it will be a net spend cut
p5440
aVthe key is whether or not we ve got prioriti that are work for you as oppos to those who have been dictat the polici in washington late and that s most lobbyist and special interest we ve got to put an end to that
p5441
aVgovern spend has gone complet out of control 10 trillion dollar debt we re give to our kid a half a trillion dollar we owe china
p5442
aVi know how to save billion of dollar in defens spend i know how to elimin program
p5443
aVi have fought against well one of them would be the market assist program anoth one would be a number of subsidi for ethanol
p5444
aVi oppos subsidi for ethanol becaus i thought it distort the market and creat inflat sen obama support those subsidi
p5445
aVi would elimin the tariff on import sugarcan base ethanol from brazil
p5446
aVi know how to save billion i save the taxpay 6 8 billion by fight a deal for a coupl of year as you might recal that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufactur dod and peopl end up in jail
p5447
aVbut i would fight for a line item veto and i would certain veto everi earmark pork barrel bill sen obama has ask for near 1 billion in pork barrel earmark project
p5448
aVinclud 3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown that s not the way we cut we ll cut out all the pork
p5449
aVwell look i think that we do have a disagr about an across the board spend freez it sound good it s propos period it doesn t happen
p5450
aVand in fact an across the board spend freez is a hatchet and we do need a scalpel becaus there are some program that don t work at all there are some program that are underfund and i want to make sure that we are focus on those program that work
p5451
aVnow sen mccain talk a lot about earmark that s one of the centerpiec of his campaign
p5452
aVearmark account for 0 5 percent of the total feder budget there s no doubt that the system need reform and there are a lot of screwi thing that we end up spend money on and they need to be elimin but it s not go to solv the problem
p5453
aVnow the last thing i think we have to focus on is a littl bit of histori just so that we understand what we re do go forward
p5454
aVwhen presid bush came into offic we had a budget surplus and the nation debt was a littl over 5 trillion it has doubl over the last eight year
p5455
aVand we are now look at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollar
p5456
aVso one of the thing that i think we have to recogn is pursu the same kind of polici that we pursu over the last eight year is not go to bring down the deficit and frank sen mccain vote for four out of five of presid bush s budget
p5457
aVwe ve got to take this in a new direct that s what i propos as presid
p5458
aVwell let let me say bob thank you
p5459
aVsure i do and let me tell you
p5460
aVyes sen obama i am not presid bush if you want to run against presid bush you should have run four year ago i m go to give a new direct to this economi in this countri
p5461
aVsen obama talk about vote for budget he vote twice for a budget resolut that increas the tax on individu make 42 000 a year of cours we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget it s complet out of control
p5462
aVthe mayor of new york mayor bloomberg just impos an across the board spend freez on new york citi they re do it all over america becaus they have to becaus they have to balanc their budget i will balanc our budget and i will get them and i will
p5463
aVreduc this i can we can do it with this kind of job creation of energi independ
p5464
aVnow look american are hurt tonight and they re angri and i understand that and they want a new direct i can bring them in that direct by elimin spend
p5465
aVsen obama talk about the budget i vote for he vote for the last two budget that had that 24 billion more in spend than the budget that the bush administr propos
p5466
aVand thank to hofstra
p5467
aVhe vote for the energi bill that was full of goodi for the oil compani that i oppos so the fact is let s look at our record sen obama let s look at it as grade by the nation taxpay union and the citizen against govern wast and the other watchdog organ
p5468
aVi have fought against spend i have fought against special interest i have fought for reform you have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leader of your parti on one singl major issu
p5469
aVwell there s a lot of stuff that was put out there so let me tri to address it first of all in term of stand up to the leader of my parti the first major bill that i vote on in the senat was in support of tort reform which wasn t veri popular with trial lawyer a major constitu in the democrat parti i support
p5470
aVan overwhelm vote
p5471
aVi support charter school and pay for perform for teacher doesn t make me popular with the teacher union i support clean coal technolog doesn t make me popular with environmentalist so i ve got a histori of reach across the aisl
p5472
aVnow with respect to a coupl of thing sen mccain said the notion that i vote for a tax increas for peopl make 42 000 a year has been disput by everybodi who has look at this claim that sen mccain keep on make
p5473
aVeven fox news disput it and that doesn t happen veri often when it come to accus about me so the fact of the matter is that if i occasion have mistaken your polici for georg bush s polici it s becaus on the core econom issu that matter to the american peopl on tax polici on energi polici on spend prioriti you have been a vigor support of presid bush
p5474
aVnow you ve shown independ commend independ on some key issu like tortur for exampl and i give you enorm credit for that but when it come to econom polici essenti what you re propos is eight more year of the same thing and it hasn t work
p5475
aVand i think the american peopl understand it hasn t work we need to move in a new direct
p5476
aVand by the way our belov nanci reagan is in the hospit tonight so our thought and prayer are go with you
p5477
aVlet me just say bob
p5478
aVok but it s veri clear that i have disagre with the bush administr i have disagre with leader of my own parti i ve got the scar to prove it
p5479
aVwhether it be bring climat chang to the floor of the senat for the first time whether it be opposit to spend and earmark whether it be the issu of tortur whether it be the conduct of the war in iraq which i vigor oppos whether it be on fight the pharmaceut compani on medicar prescript drug import whether it be fight for an hmo patient s bill of right whether it be the establish of the 9 11 commiss
p5480
aVi have a long record of reform and fight through on the floor of the unit state senat
p5481
aVsen obama your argument for stand up to the leadership of your parti isn t veri convinc
p5482
aVit s good to see you again sen obama
p5483
aVwell this has been a tough campaign it s been a veri tough campaign and i know from my experi in mani campaign that if sen obama had ask respond to my urgent request to sit down and do town hall meet and come befor the american peopl we could have done at least 10 of them by now
p5484
aVwhen sen obama was first ask he said ani place ani time the way barri goldwat and jack kennedi agre to do befor the intervent of the tragedi at dalla so i think the tone of this campaign could have been veri differ
p5485
aVand the fact is it s gotten pretti tough and i regret some of the negat aspect of both campaign but the fact is that it has taken mani turn which i think are unaccept
p5486
aVone of them happen just the other day when a man i admir and respect i ve written about him congressman john lewi an american hero made alleg that sarah palin and i were somehow associ with the worst chapter in american histori segreg death of children in church bomb georg wallac that to me was so hurt
p5487
aVand sen obama you didn t repudi those remark everi time there s been an out of bound remark made by a republican no matter where they are i have repudi them i hope that sen obama will repudi those remark that were made by congressman john lewi veri unfair and total inappropri
p5488
aVso i want to tell you we will run a truth campaign this is a tough campaign and it s a matter of fact that sen obama has spent more money on negat ad than ani polit campaign in histori and i can prove it
p5489
aVand sen obama when he said and he sign a piec of paper that said he would take public financ for his campaign if i did that was back when he was a long shot candid you didn t keep your word
p5490
aVamerican are hurt right now and they re angri they re hurt and they re angri they re innoc victim of greed and excess on wall street and as well as washington d c and they re angri and they have everi reason to be angri
p5491
aVand when you look into the camera in a debat with sen clinton and said i will sit down and negoti with john mccain about public financ befor i make a decis you didn t tell the american peopl the truth becaus you didn t
p5492
aVand that s that s that s an unfortun part now we have the highest spend by sen obama s campaign than ani time sinc waterg
p5493
aVwell look you know i think that we expect presidenti campaign to be tough i think that if you look at the record and the impress of the american peopl bob your network just did a poll show that two third of the american peopl think that sen mccain is run a negat campaign versus one third of mine
p5494
aVand 100 percent john of your ad 100 percent of them have been negat
p5495
aVit s not true
p5496
aVit absolut is true and now i think the american peopl are less interest in our hurt feel dure the cours of the campaign than address the issu that matter to them so deepli
p5497
aVand there is noth wrong with us have a vigor debat like we re have tonight about health care about energi polici about tax polici that s the stuff that campaign should be made of
p5498
aVthe notion though that becaus we re not do town hall meet that justifi some of the ad that have been go up not just from your own campaign direct john but 527s and other organ that make some pretti tough accus well i don t mind be attack for the next three week
p5499
aVwhat the american peopl can t afford though is four more year of fail econom polici and what they deserv over the next four week is that we talk about what s most press to them the econom crisi
p5500
aVand they want this countri to go in a new direct and there are element of my propos that you just outlin which i won t repeat
p5501
aVsen mccain s own campaign said public last week that if we keep on talk about the econom crisi we lose so we need to chang the subject
p5502
aVand i would love to see the next three week devot to talk about the economi devot to talk about health care devot to talk about energi and figur out how the american peopl can send their kid to colleg
p5503
aVand that is someth that i would welcom but it requir i think a recognit that polit as usual as been practic over the last sever year is not solv the big problem here in america
p5504
aVwell if you ll turn on the televis as i i watch the arizona cardin defeat the dalla cowboy on sunday
p5505
aVcongratul
p5506
aVeveri other ad ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan and ani object observ has said it s not true you re run ad right now that say that i oppos feder fund for stem cell research i don t
p5507
aVyou re run ad that misportray complet my posit on immigr so the fact is that sen obama is spend unpreced unpreced in the histori of american polit go back to the begin amount of money in negat attack ad on me
p5508
aVand of cours i ve been talk about the economi of cours i ve talk to peopl like joe the plumber and tell him that i m not go to spread his wealth around i m go to let him keep his wealth and of cours we re talk about posit plan of action to restor this economi and restor job in america
p5509
aVthat s what my campaign is all about and that s what it ll continu to be all about
p5510
aVbut again i did not hear a repudi of congressman
p5511
aVbut we also have to have a short term fix in my view and long term fix
p5512
aVi mean look if we want to talk about congressman lewi who is an american hero he unprompt by my campaign without my campaign s awar made a statement that he was troubl with what he was hear at some of the ralli that your run mate was hold in which all the republican report indic were shout when my name came up thing like terrorist and kill him and that you re run mate didn t mention didn t stop didn t say hold on a second that s kind of out of line
p5513
aVand i think congressman lewi point was that we have to be care about how we deal with our support
p5514
aVnow
p5515
aVyou ve got to read what he said
p5516
aVcrosstalk
p5517
aVlet let let
p5518
aVyou ve got to read what he said
p5519
aVlet me let me complet
p5520
aVmy respons i do think that he inappropri drew a comparison between what was happen there and what had happen dure the civil right movement and we immedi put out a statement say that we don t think that comparison is appropri
p5521
aVlet me just talk to you about one of the short term fix
p5522
aVand in fact afterward congressman lewi put out a similar statement say that he had probabl gone over the line
p5523
aVthe import point here is though the american peopl have becom so cynic about our polit becaus all they see is a tit for tat and back and forth and what they want is the abil to just focus on some realli big challeng that we face right now and that s what i have been tri to focus on this entir campaign
p5524
aVi cannot
p5525
aVwe can have serious differ about our health care polici for exampl john becaus we do have a differ on health care polici but we
p5526
aVwe do and i hope
p5527
aVtalk about it this even
p5528
aVsure
p5529
aVbut when peopl suggest that i pal around with terrorist then we re not talk about issu what we re talk about
p5530
aVwell let me just say i would
p5531
aVthe catalyst for this hous crisi was the fanni and freddi mae that caus subprim lend situat that now caus the hous market in america to collaps
p5532
aVlet me just say categor i m proud of the peopl that come to our ralli whenev you get a larg ralli of 10 000 15 000 20 000 peopl you re go to have some fring peopl you know that and i ve and we ve alway said that that s not appropri
p5533
aVbut to somehow say that group of young women who said militari wive for mccain are somehow say anyth derogatori about you but anyth and those veteran that wear those hat that say world war ii vietnam korea iraq i m not go to stand for peopl say that the peopl that come to my ralli are anyth but the most dedic patriot men and women that are in this nation and they re great citizen
p5534
aVand i m not go to stand for somebodi say that becaus someon yell someth at a ralli there s a lot of thing that have been yell at your ralli sen obama that i m not happi about either
p5535
aVin fact some t shirt that are veri
p5536
aVjohn i
p5537
aVunaccept so the point is the point is that i have repudi everi time someon s been out of line whether they ve been part of my campaign or not and i will continu to do that
p5538
aVbut the fact is that we need to absolut not stand for the kind of thing that have been go on i haven t
p5539
aVwell look bob as i said
p5540
aVyou know here s what i would say i mean we can have a debat back and forth about the merit of each other s campaign i suspect we won t agre here tonight
p5541
aVi am convinc that until we revers this continu declin in home ownership and put a floor under it and so that peopl have not onli the hope and belief they can stay in their home and realiz the american dream but that valu will come up
p5542
aVwhat i think is most import is that we recogn that to solv the key problem that we re face if we re go to solv two war the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress if we can if we re go to focus on lift wage that have declin over the last eight year and creat job here in america then democrat independ and republican we re go to have to be abl to work togeth
p5543
aVand what is import is make sure that we disagre without be disagre and it mean that we can have tough vigor debat around issu what we can t do i think is tri to character each other as bad peopl and that has been a cultur in washington that has been take place for too long and i think
p5544
aVwell bob you ask me a direct question
p5545
aVyes real quick mr ayer i don t care about an old wash up terrorist but as sen clinton said in her debat with you we need to know the full extent of that relationship
p5546
aVwe need to know the full extent of sen obama s relationship with acorn who is now on the verg of mayb perpetr one of the greatest fraud in voter histori in this countri mayb destroy the fabric of democraci the same front outfit organ that your campaign gave 832 000 for light and site select so all of these thing need to be examin of cours
p5547
aVbob i think it s go to be import to just i ll respond to these two particular alleg that sen mccain has made and that have gotten a lot of attent
p5548
aVin fact mr ayer has becom the centerpiec of sen mccain s campaign over the last two or three week this has been their primari focus so let s get the record straight bill ayer is a professor of educ in chicago
p5549
aVforti year ago when i was 8 year old he engag in despic act with a radic domest group i have round condemn those act ten year ago he serv and i serv on a school reform board that was fund by one of ronald reagan s former ambassador and close friend mr annenberg
p5550
aVnow we have alloc 750 billion let s take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgag and negoti with those peopl in their home 11 million home or more so that they can afford to pay the mortgag stay in their home
p5551
aVother member on that board were the presid of the univers of illinoi the presid of northwestern univers who happen to be a republican the presid of the chicago tribun a republican lean newspap
p5552
aVmr ayer is not involv in my campaign he has never been involv in this campaign and he will not advis me in the white hous so that s mr ayer
p5553
aVnow with respect to acorn acorn is a communiti organ appar what they ve done is they were pay peopl to go out and regist folk and appar some of the peopl who were out there didn t realli regist peopl they just fill out a bunch of name
p5554
aVit had noth to do with us we were not involv the onli involv i ve had with acorn was i repres them alongsid the u s justic depart in make illinoi implement a motor voter law that help peopl get regist at dmvs
p5555
aVnow the reason i think that it s import to just get these fact out is becaus the alleg that sen mccain has continu made is that somehow my associ are troubl
p5556
aVlet me tell you who i associ with on econom polici i associ with warren buffett and former fed chairman paul volcker if i m interest in figur out my foreign polici i associ myself with my run mate joe biden or with dick lugar the republican rank member on the senat foreign relat committe or general jim jone the former suprem alli command of nato
p5557
aVthose are the peopl democrat and republican who have shape my idea and who will be surround me in the white hous and i think the fact that this has becom such an import part of your campaign sen mccain say more about your campaign than it say about me
p5558
aVwell again while you were on the board of the wood foundat you and mr ayer togeth you sent 230 000 to acorn so and you launch your polit campaign in mr ayer live room
p5559
aVthat s absolut not true
p5560
aVand the fact are fact and record are record
p5561
aVnow i know the critic of this
p5562
aVand that s not the fact
p5563
aVand it s not the fact it s not the fact that sen obama choos to associ with a guy who in 2001 said that he wish he had have bomb more and he had a long associ with him it s the fact that all the all of the detail need to be known about sen obama s relationship with them and with acorn and the american peopl will make a judgment
p5564
aVand my campaign is about get this economi back on track about creat job about a brighter futur for america and that s what my campaign is about and i m not go to rais tax the way sen obama want to rais tax in a tough economi and that s realli what this campaign is go to be about
p5565
aVwell joe biden i think is one of the finest public servant that has serv in this countri it s not just that he has some of the best foreign polici credenti of anybodi and democrat and republican alik i think acknowledg his expertis there
p5566
aVbut it s also that his entir life he has never forgotten where he came from come from scranton fight on behalf of work famili rememb what it s like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral econom
p5567
aVand as a consequ his consist pattern throughout his career is to fight for the littl guy that s what he s done when it come to econom polici that will help work famili get a leg up
p5568
aVthat s what he s done when it come to for exampl pass the landmark 1994 crime bill the violenc against women s act joe has alway made sure that he is fight on behalf of work famili and i think he share my core valu and my sens of where the countri need to go
p5569
aVwell what about the citizen that stay in their home that paid their mortgag payment it doesn t help that person in their home if the next door neighbor s hous is abandon and so we ve got to revers this we ought to put the homeown first and i am disappoint that secretari paulson and other have not made that their first prioriti
p5570
aVbecaus after eight year of fail polici he and i both agre that what we re go to have to do is to re priorit make sure that we re invest in the american peopl give tax cut not to the wealthiest corpor but give them to small busi and give them to individu who are struggl right now make sure that we final get serious about energi independ someth that has been languish in washington for 30 year and make sure that our kid get a great educ and can afford to go to colleg
p5571
aVso on the key issu that are of import to american famili joe biden s alway been on the right side and i think he will make an outstand presid if heaven forbid someth happen to me
p5572
aVwell american have gotten to know sarah palin they know that she s a role model to women and other and reform all over america
p5573
aVshe s a reform she is she took on a governor who was a member of her own parti when she ran for governor when she was the head of their energi and natur resourc board she saw corrupt she resign and said this can t go on
p5574
aVshe s given money back to the taxpay she s cut the size of govern she negoti with the oil compani and face them down a 40 billion pipelin of natur gas that s go to reliev the energi need of the unit of what they call the lower 48
p5575
aVshe s a reform through and through and it s time we had that bresh of freth air sic breath of fresh air come into our nation s capit and sweep out the old boy network and the cronyism that s been so much a part of it that i ve fought against for all these year
p5576
aVshe ll be my partner she understand reform and by the way she also understand special need famili she understand that autism is on the rise that we ve got to find out what s caus it and we ve got to reach out to these famili and help them and give them the help they need as they rais these veri special need children
p5577
aVshe understand that better than almost ani american that i know i m proud of her
p5578
aVand she has ignit our parti and peopl all over america that have never been involv in the polit process and i can t tell how proud i am of her and her famili
p5579
aVher husband s a pretti tough guy by the way too
p5580
aVyou know i think it s that s go to be up to the american peopl i think that obvious she s a capabl politician who has i think excit the a base in the republican parti
p5581
aVand i think it s veri commend the work she s done on behalf of special need i agre with that john
p5582
aVi do want to just point out that autism for exampl or other special need will requir some addit fund if we re go to get serious in term of research that is someth that everi famili that advoc on behalf of disabl children talk about
p5583
aVand if we have an across the board spend freez we re not go to be abl to do it that s an exampl of i think the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we re fund some of those program
p5584
aVi think that joe biden is qualifi in mani respect but i do point out that he s been wrong on mani foreign polici and nation secur issu which is suppos to be his strength
p5585
aVhe vote against the first gulf war he vote against it and obvious we had to take saddam hussein out of kuwait or it would ve threaten the middl eastern world suppli
p5586
aVin iraq he had this cockamami idea about divid iraq into three countri we re see iraq unit as iraqi tough hard but we re see them we re now about to have an agreement for status of forc in iraq come up
p5587
aVwell first of all i want to thank hofstra univers and the peopl of new york for host us tonight and it s wonder to join sen mccain again and thank you bob
p5588
aVthere are sever issu in which frank joe biden and i open and honest disagre on nation secur polici and he s been wrong on a number of the major one
p5589
aVbut again i want to come back to notic everi time sen obama say we need to spend more we need to spend more that s the answer whi do we alway have to spend more
p5590
aVwhi can t we have transpar account reform of these agenc of govern mayb that s whi he s ask for 860 sought and propos 860 billion worth of new spend and want to rais peopl s tax in a time of incred challeng and difficulti and heartach for the american famili
p5591
aVclimat chang
p5592
aVi think everybodi understand at this point that we are experienc the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress and the financi rescu plan that sen mccain and i support is an import first step and i push for some core principl make sure that taxpay can get their money back if they re put money up make sure that ceo are not enrich themselv through this process
p5593
aVi think we can for all intent and purpos elimin our depend on middl eastern oil and venezuelan oil canadian oil is fine
p5594
aVby the way when sen obama said he would unilater renegoti the north american free trade agreement the canadian said yes and we ll sell our oil to china
p5595
aVyou don t tell countri you re go to unilater renegoti agreement with them
p5596
aVwe can elimin our depend on foreign oil by build 45 new nuclear plant power plant right away we can store and we can reprocess
p5597
aVsen obama will tell you in the as the extrem environmentalist do it has to be safe
p5598
aVlook we ve sail navi ship around the world for 60 year with nuclear power plant on them we can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel sen obama no problem
p5599
aVso the point is with nuclear power with wind tide solar natur gas with develop of flex fuel hybrid clean coal technolog clean coal technolog is key in the heartland of america that s hurt rather bad
p5600
aVso i think we can easili within seven eight ten year if we put our mind to it we can elimin our depend on the place in the world that harm our nation secur if we don t achiev our independ
p5601
aVi think that in ten year we can reduc our depend so that we no longer have to import oil from the middl east or venezuela i think that s about a realist timefram
p5602
aVand i think that it s go to take some time to work itself out but what we haven t yet seen is a rescu packag for the middl class becaus the fundament of the economi were weak even befor this latest crisi so i ve propos four specif thing that i think can help
p5603
aVand this is the most import issu that our futur economi is go to face obvious we ve got an immedi crisi right now but noth is more import than us no longer borrow 700 billion or more from china and send it to saudi arabia it s mortgag our children s futur
p5604
aVnow from the start of this campaign i ve identifi this as one of my top prioriti and here is what i think we have to do
p5605
aVnumber one we do need to expand domest product and that mean for exampl tell the oil compani the 68 million acr that they current have leas that they re not drill use them or lose them
p5606
aVand i think that we should look at offshor drill and implement it in a way that allow us to get some addit oil but understand we onli have three to four percent of the world s oil reserv and we use 25 percent of the world s oil which mean that we can t drill our way out of the problem
p5607
aVthat s whi i ve focus on put resourc into solar wind biodiesel geotherm these have been prioriti of mine sinc i got to the senat and it is absolut critic that we develop a high fuel effici car that s built not in japan and not in south korea but built here in the unit state of america
p5608
aVwe invent the auto industri and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is someth that we have to work on
p5609
aVnow i just want to make one last point becaus sen mccain mention nafta and the issu of trade and that actual bear on this issu i believ in free trade but i also believ that for far too long certain dure the cours of the bush administr with the support of sen mccain the attitud has been that ani trade agreement is a good trade agreement and nafta doesn t have did not have enforc labor agreement and environment agreement
p5610
aVand what i said was we should includ those and make them enforc in the same way that we should enforc rule against china manipul it currenc to make our export more expens and their export to us cheaper
p5611
aVand when it come to south korea we ve got a trade agreement up right now they are send hundr of thousand of south korean car into the unit state that s all good we can onli get 4 000 to 5 000 into south korea that is not free trade we ve got to have a presid who is go to be advoc on behalf of american busi and american worker and i make no apolog for that
p5612
aVnumber one let s focus on job i want to end the tax break for compani that are ship job oversea and provid a tax credit for everi compani that s creat a job right here in america
p5613
aVwell you know i admir so much sen obama s eloqu and you realli have to pay attent to word he said we will look at offshor drill did you get that look at we can offshor drill now we ve got to do it now we will reduc the cost of a barrel of oil becaus we show the world that we have a suppli of our own it s doabl the technolog is there and we have to drill now
p5614
aVnow on the subject of free trade agreement i am a free trader and i need we need to have educ and train program for displac worker that work go to our communiti colleg
p5615
aVbut let me give you anoth exampl of a free trade agreement that sen obama oppos right now becaus of previous agreement some made by presid clinton the good and product that we send to colombia which is our largest agricultur import of our product is there s a billion dollar that we our busi have paid so far in order to get our good in there
p5616
aVbecaus of previous agreement their good and product come into our countri for free so sen obama who has never travel south of our border oppos the colombia free trade agreement the same countri that s help us tri to stop the flow of drug into our countri that s kill young american
p5617
aVand also the countri that just freed three american that will help us creat job in america becaus they will be a market for our good and product without have to pay without us have to pay the billion of dollar the billion dollar and more that we ve alreadi paid
p5618
aVfree trade with colombia is someth that s a no brainer but mayb you ought to travel down there and visit them and mayb you could understand it a lot better
p5619
aVlet me respond actual i understand it pretti well the histori in colombia right now is that labor leader have been target for assassin on a fair consist basi and there have not been prosecut
p5620
aVand what i have said becaus the free trade the trade agreement itself doe have labor and environment protect but we have to stand for human right and we have to make sure that violenc isn t be perpetr against worker who are just tri to organ for their right which is whi for exampl i support the peruvian free trade agreement which was a well structur agreement
p5621
aVbut i think that the import point is we ve got to have a presid who understand the benefit of free trade but also is go to enforc unfair trade agreement and is go to stand up to other countri
p5622
aVand the last point i ll make becaus we start on energi when i talk about the automak they are obvious get hammer right now they were alreadi have a tough time becaus of high gas price and now with the financi crisi car dealership are close and peopl can t get car loan
p5623
aVnumber two let s help famili right away by provid them a tax cut a middl class tax cut for peopl make less than 200 000 and let s allow them to access their ira account without penalti if they re experienc a crisi
p5624
aVthat s whi i think it s import for us to get loan guarante to the automak but we do have to hold them respons as well to start produc the high fuel effici car of the futur
p5625
aVand detroit had drag it feet too long in term of get that done it s go to be one of my highest prioriti becaus transport account for about 30 percent of our total energi consumpt
p5626
aVif we can get that right then we can move in a direct not onli of energi independ but we can creat 5 million new job all across america includ in the heartland where we can retool some of these plant to make these high fuel effici car and also to make wind turbin and solar panel the kind of clean energi approach that should be the driver of our economi for the next centuri
p5627
aVwell let me just said that that this is he sen obama doesn t want a free trade agreement with our best alli in the region but want to sit down across the tabl without precondit to with hugo chavez the guy who has been help farc the terrorist organ
p5628
aVfree trade between ourselv and colombia i just recit to you the benefit of conclud that agreement a billion dollar of american dollar that could have gone to creat job and busi in the unit state open up those market
p5629
aVso i don t i don t think there s ani doubt that sen obama want to restrict trade and he want to rais tax and the last presid of the unit state that tri that was herbert hoover and we went from a deep recess into a depress
p5630
aVwe re not go to follow that path while i m when i m presid of the unit state
p5631
aVwe ve got to do both and that s exact what my plan doe
p5632
aVlook as i travel around the countri this is the issu that will break your heart over and over again just yesterday i was in toledo shake some hand in a line two women both of them probabl in their mid to late 50s had just been laid off of their plant neither of them have health insur
p5633
aVnow sen mccain and i agre with your idea that we ve got to help homeown that s whi we includ in the financi packag a propos to get homeown in a posit where they can renegoti their mortgag
p5634
aVand they were desper for some way of get coverag becaus understand they re worri that if they get sick they could go bankrupt
p5635
aVso here s what my plan doe if you have health insur then you don t have to do anyth if you ve got health insur through your employ you can keep your health insur keep your choic of doctor keep your plan
p5636
aVthe onli thing we re go to tri to do is lower cost so that those cost save are pass onto you and we estim we can cut the averag famili s premium by about 2 500 per year
p5637
aVif you don t have health insur then what we re go to do is to provid you the option of buy into the same kind of feder pool that both sen mccain and i enjoy as feder employe which will give you high qualiti care choic of doctor at lower cost becaus so mani peopl are part of this insur group
p5638
aVwe re go to make sure that insur compani can t discrimin on the basi of pre exist condit we ll negoti with the drug compani for the cheapest avail price on drug
p5639
aVwe are go to invest in inform technolog to elimin bureaucraci and make the system more effici
p5640
aVand we are go to make sure that we manag chronic ill like diabet and heart diseas that cost a huge amount but could be prevent we ve got to put more money into prevent care
p5641
aVthis will cost some money on the front end but over the long term this is the onli way that not onli are we go to make famili healthi but it s also how we re go to save the feder budget becaus we can t afford these escal cost
p5642
aVi disagre with sen mccain in how to do it becaus the way sen mccain has design his plan it could be a giveaway to bank if we re buy full price for mortgag that now are worth a lot less and we don t want to wast taxpay money and we ve got to get the financi packag work much quicker than it has been work
p5643
aVwell it is a terribl pain situat for american they re see their premium their co pay go up forti seven million american are without health insur in america today
p5644
aVand it realli is the cost the escal cost of health care that are inflict such pain on work famili and peopl across this countri and i am convinc we need to do a lot of thing
p5645
aVwe need to put health care record onlin the v a doe that that will that will reduc cost we need to have more communiti health center we need to have walk in clinic
p5646
aVthe rise of obes amongst young american is one of the most alarm statist that there is we should have physic fit program and nutrit program in school everi parent should know what s go on there
p5647
aVwe we need to have we need to have employ reward employe who join health club and practic well and fit
p5648
aVbut i want to give everi american famili a 5 000 refund tax credit take it and get anywher in america the health care that you wish
p5649
aVnow my old buddi joe joe the plumber is out there now joe sen obama s plan if you re a small busi and you are abl and your the guy that sell to you will not have his capit gain tax increas which sen obama want if you re out there my friend and you ve got employe and you ve got kid if you don t get adopt the health care plan that sen obama mandat he s go to fine you
p5650
aVnow sen obama i d like still like to know what that fine is go to be and i don t think that joe right now want to pay a fine when he is see such difficult time in america s economi
p5651
aVsen obama want to set up health care bureaucraci take over the health care of america through as he said his object is a singl payer system
p5652
aVif you like that you ll love canada and england so the point is
p5653
aVlast point i want to make though we ve got some long term challeng in this economi that have to be dealt with we ve got to fix our energi polici that s give our wealth away we ve got to fix our health care system and we ve got to invest in our educ system for everi young person to be abl to learn
p5654
aVit is not and i didn t describ it
p5655
aVno you state it
p5656
aVi just
p5657
aVexcus me
p5658
aVi just describ what my plan is and i m happi to talk to you joe too if you re out there here s your fine zero you won t pay a fine becaus
p5659
aVzero
p5660
aVzero becaus as i said in our last debat and i ll repeat john i exempt small busi from the requir for larg busi that can afford to provid health care to their employe but are not do it
p5661
aVi exempt small busi from have to pay into a kitti but larg busi that can afford it we ve got a choic either they provid health insur to their employe or somebodi has to
p5662
aVright now what happen is those employe get dump into either the medicaid system which taxpay pick up or they re go to the emerg room for uncompens care which everybodi pick up in their premium
p5663
aVthe averag famili is pay an addit 900 a year in higher premium becaus of the uninsur
p5664
aVso here s what we do we exempt small busi in fact what joe if you want to do the right thing with your employe and you want to provid them health insur we ll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actual be abl to afford it
p5665
aVif you don t have health insur or you want to buy into a group plan you will be abl to buy into the plan that i just describ
p5666
aVnow what we haven t talk about is sen mccain s plan he say he s go to give you all a 5 000 tax credit that sound pretti good and you can go out and buy your own insur
p5667
aVhere s the problem that for about 20 million peopl you may find yourselv no longer have employ base health insur this is becaus younger peopl might be abl to get health insur for 5 000 young and healthi folk
p5668
aVolder folk let s healthi folk what s go to end up happen is that you re go to be the onli one left in your employ base system your employ won t be abl to afford it
p5669
aVand onc you re out on your own with this 5 000 credit sen mccain for the first time is go to be tax the health care benefit that you have from your employ
p5670
aVand this is your plan john for the first time in histori you will be tax peopl s health care benefit
p5671
aVby the way the averag polici cost about 12 000 so if you ve got 5 000 and it s go to cost you 12 000 that s a loss for you
p5672
aVlast point about sen mccain s plan is that insur right now the main restrict on what they do is primarili state law and under sen mccain s plan those rule would be strip away and you would start see a lot more insur compani cherri pick and exclud peopl from coverag
p5673
aVno i would like to mention that a coupl day ago sen obama was out in ohio and he had an encount with a guy who s a plumber his name is joe wurzelbach
p5674
aVthat i think is a mistak and i think that this is a fundament differ in our campaign and how we would approach health care
p5675
aVhey joe you re rich congratul becaus what joe want to do was buy the busi that he s been work for 10 12 hour a day seven day a week and you said that you want to spread the wealth but in other word take joe s money and then you decid what to do with it
p5676
aVnow joe you re rich congratul and you will then fall into the categori where you ll have to pay a fine if you don t provid health insur that sen obama mandat not the kind that you think is best for your famili your children your employe but the kind that he mandat for you
p5677
aVthat s big govern at it best
p5678
aVnow 95 percent of the peopl in america will receiv more money under my plan becaus they will receiv not onli their present benefit which may be tax which will be tax but then you add 5 000 onto it except for those peopl who have the gold plate cadillac insur polici that have to do with cosmet surgeri and transplant and all of those kind of thing
p5679
aVand the good thing about this is they ll be abl to go across america the averag cost of a health care insur plan in america today is 5 800 i m go to give them 5 000 to take with them wherev they want to go and this will give them afford
p5680
aVthis will give them avail this will give them a chanc to choos their own futur not have sen obama and govern decid that for them
p5681
aVthis realli get down to the fundament differ in our philosophi if you notic that in all of this propos senat govern want sen obama want govern to do the job
p5682
aVsen obama want govern to do the job i want joe you to do the job
p5683
aVjoe want to buy the busi that he has been in for all of these year work 10 12 hour a day and he want to buy the busi but he look at your tax plan and he saw that he was go to pay much higher tax
p5684
aVi want to leav money in your pocket i want you to be abl to choos the health care for you and your famili that s what i m all about and we ve got too much govern and too much spend and the govern is the size of govern has grown by 40 percent in the last eight year
p5685
aVwe can t afford that in the next eight year and sen obama with the democrat in charg of congress thing have gotten wors have you notic they ve been in charg the last two year
p5686
aVveri briefli you all just heard my plan if you ve got an employ base health care plan you keep it now under sen mccain s plan there is a strong risk that peopl would lose their employ base health care
p5687
aVthat s the choic you ll have is have your employ no longer provid you health care and don t take my word for it the u s chamber of commerc which general doesn t support a lot of democrat said that this plan could lead to the unravel of the employ base health care system
p5688
aVall i want to do if you ve alreadi got health care is lower your cost that includ you joe
p5689
aVi would never and have never in all the year i ve been there impos a litmus test on ani nomine to the court that s not appropri to do
p5690
aVyou were go to put him in a higher tax bracket which was go to increas his tax which was go to caus him not to be abl to employ peopl which joe was tri to realiz the american dream
p5691
aVi thought it was a bad decis i think there were a lot of decis that were bad i think that decis should rest in the hand of the state i m a federalist and i believ strong that we should have nomine to the unit state suprem court base on their qualif rather than ani litmus test
p5692
aVnow let me say that there was a time a few year ago when the unit state senat was about to blow up republican want to have just a major vote to confirm a judg and the democrat were block in an unpreced fashion
p5693
aVwe got togeth seven republican seven democrat you were offer a chanc to join you chose not to becaus you were afraid of the appoint of quot conserv judg
p5694
aVi vote for justic breyer and justic ginsburg not becaus i agre with their ideolog but becaus i thought they were qualifi and that elect have consequ when presid are nomin this is a veri import issu we re talk about
p5695
aVsen obama vote against justic breyer and justic robert on the ground that they didn t meet his ideolog standard that s not the way we should judg these nomine elect have consequ they should be judg on their qualif and so that s what i will do
p5696
aVi will find the best peopl in the world in the unit state of america who have a histori of strict adher to the constitut and not legisl from the bench
p5697
aVi would consid anyon in their qualif i do not believ that someon who has support roe v wade that would be part of those qualif but i certain would not impos ani litmus test
p5698
aVwell i think it s true that we shouldn t appli a strict litmus test and the most import thing in ani judg is their capac to provid fair and justic to the american peopl
p5699
aVnow sen obama talk about the veri veri rich joe i want to tell you i ll not onli help you buy that busi that you work your whole life for and be abl and i ll keep your tax low and i ll provid avail and afford health care for you and your employe
p5700
aVand it is true that this is go to be i think one of the most consequenti decis of the next presid it is veri like that one of us will be make at least one and probabl more than one appoint and roe versus wade probabl hang in the balanc
p5701
aVnow i would not provid a litmus test but i am somebodi who believ that roe versus wade was right decid i think that abort is a veri difficult issu and it is a moral issu and one that i think good peopl on both side can disagre on
p5702
aVbut what ultim i believ is that women in consult with their famili their doctor their religi advis are in the best posit to make this decis and i think that the constitut has a right to privaci in it that shouldn t be subject to state referendum ani more than our first amend right are subject to state referendum ani more than mani of the other right that we have should be subject to popular vote
p5703
aVso this is go to be an import issu i will look for those judg who have an outstand judici record who have the intellect and who hope have a sens of what real world folk are go through
p5704
aVi ll just give you one quick exampl sen mccain and i disagre recent when the suprem court made it more difficult for a woman name lilli ledbett to press her claim for pay discrimin
p5705
aVfor year she had been get paid less than a man had been paid for do the exact same job and when she brought a suit say equal pay for equal work the judg said well you know it s taken you too long to bring this lawsuit even though she didn t know about it until fair recent
p5706
aVwe tri to overturn it in the senat i support that effort to provid better guidanc to the court john mccain oppos it
p5707
aVi think that it s import for judg to understand that if a woman is out there tri to rais a famili tri to support her famili and is be treat unfair then the court has to stand up if nobodi els will and that s the kind of judg that i want
p5708
aVobvious that law wave the statut of limit which you could have gone back 20 or 30 year it was a trial lawyer s dream
p5709
aVand i will not have i will not stand for a tax increas on small busi incom fifti percent of small busi incom tax are paid by small busi that s 16 million job in america and what you want to do to joe the plumber and million more like him is have their tax increas and not be abl to realiz the american dream of own their own busi
p5710
aVlet me talk to you about an import aspect of this issu we have to chang the cultur of america those of us who are proud pro life understand that and it s got to be courag and compass that we show to a young woman who s face this terribl difficult decis
p5711
aVsen obama as a member of the illinoi state senat vote in the judiciari committe against a law that would provid immedi medic attent to a child born of a fail abort he vote against that
p5712
aVand then on the floor of the state senat as he did 130 time as a state senat he vote present
p5713
aVthen there was anoth bill befor the senat judiciari committe in the state of illinoi not that long ago where he vote against a ban on partial birth abort one of the late term abort a realli one of the bad procedur a terribl and then on the floor of the illinoi state senat he vote present
p5714
aVi don t know how you vote present on some of that i don t know how you align yourself with the extrem aspect of the pro abort movement in america and that s his record and that s a matter of his record
p5715
aVand he ll say it has someth to do with roe v wade about the illinoi state senat it was clear cut vote that sen obama vote i think in direct contradict to the feel and view of mainstream america
p5716
aVyes let me respond to this if it sound incred that i would vote to withhold lifesav treatment from an infant that s becaus it s not true the here are the fact
p5717
aVthere was a bill that was put forward befor the illinoi senat that said you have to provid lifesav treatment and that would have help to undermin roe v wade the fact is that there was alreadi a law on the book in illinoi that requir provid lifesav treatment which is whi not onli myself but pro choic republican and democrat vote against it
p5718
aVand the illinoi medic societi the organ of doctor in illinoi vote against it their hippocrat oath would have requir them to provid care and there was alreadi a law in the book
p5719
aVwith respect to partial birth abort i am complet support of a ban on late term abort partial birth or otherwis as long as there s an except for the mother s health and life and this did not contain that except
p5720
aVand i attempt as mani have in the past of includ that so that it is constitut and that was reject and that s whi i vote present becaus i m will to support a ban on late term abort as long as we have that except
p5721
aVthe last point i want to make on the issu of abort this is an issu that look it divid us and in some way it may be difficult to to reconcil the two view
p5722
aVbut there sure is some common ground when both those who believ in choic and those who are oppos to abort can come togeth and say we should tri to prevent unintend pregnanc by provid appropri educ to our youth communic that sexual is sacr and that they should not be engag in cavali activ and provid option for adopt and help singl mother if they want to choos to keep the babi
p5723
aVthose are all thing that we put in the democrat platform for the first time this year and i think that s where we can find some common ground becaus nobodi s pro abort i think it s alway a tragic situat
p5724
aVwe should tri to reduc these circumst
p5725
aVjust again
p5726
aVjust again the exampl of the eloqu of sen obama he s health for the mother you know that s been stretch by the pro abort movement in america to mean almost anyth
p5727
aVthat s what joe believ
p5728
aVthat s the extrem pro abort posit quot health but look cindi and i are adopt parent we know what a treasur and joy it is to have an adopt child in our live we ll do everyth we can to improv adopt in this countri
p5729
aVbut that doe not mean that we will ceas to protect the right of the unborn of cours we have to come togeth of cours we have to work togeth and of cours it s vital that we do so and help these young women who are face such a difficult decis with a compass that we ll help them with the adopt servic with the courag to bring that child into this world and we ll help take care of it
p5730
aVthis probabl has more to do with our econom futur than anyth and that mean it also has a nation secur implic becaus there s never been a nation on earth that saw it economi declin and continu to maintain it primaci as a militari power
p5731
aVso we ve got to get our educ system right now typic what s happen is that there s been a debat between more money or reform and i think we need both
p5732
aVin some case we are go to have to invest earli childhood educ which close the achiev gap so that everi child is prepar for school everi dollar we invest in that we end up get huge benefit with improv read score reduc dropout rate reduc delinqu rate
p5733
aVhe has been watch ad of sen mccain s let me tell you what i m actual go to do i think tax polici is a major differ between sen mccain and myself and we both want to cut tax the differ is who we want to cut tax for
p5734
aVi think it s go to be critic import for us to recruit a generat of new teacher an armi of new teacher especi in math and scienc give them higher pay give them more profession develop and support in exchang for higher standard and account
p5735
aVand i think it s import for us to make colleg afford right now i meet young peopl all across the countri who either have decid not to go to colleg or if they re go to colleg they are take on 20 000 30 000 50 000 60 000 worth of debt and it s veri difficult for them to go into some field like basic research in scienc for exampl think to themselv that they re go to have a mortgag befor they even buy a hous
p5736
aVand that s whi i ve propos a 4 000 tuition credit everi student everi year in exchang for some form of communiti servic whether it s militari servic whether it s peac corp whether it s work in a communiti
p5737
aVif we do those thing then i believ that we can creat a better school system
p5738
aVbut there s one last ingredi that i just want to mention and that s parent we can t do it just in the school parent are go to have to show more respons they ve got to turn off the tv set put away the video game and final start instil that thirst for knowledg that our student need
p5739
aVwell it s the civil right issu of the 21st centuri there s no doubt that we have achiev equal access to school in america after a long and difficult and terribl struggl
p5740
aVbut what is the advantag in a low incom area of send a child to a fail school and that be your onli choic
p5741
aVso choic and competit amongst school is one of the key element that s alreadi been proven in place in like new orlean and new york citi and other place where we have charter school where we take good teacher and we reward them and promot them
p5742
aVand we find bad teacher anoth line of work and we have to be abl to give parent the same choic frank that sen obama and mrs obama had and cindi and i had to send our kid to the school their kid to the school of their choic
p5743
aVnow sen mccain the centerpiec of his econom propos is to provid 200 billion in addit tax break to some of the wealthiest corpor in america exxon mobil and other oil compani for exampl would get an addit 4 billion in tax break
p5744
aVcharter school aren t the onli answer but they re provid competit they are provid the kind of competit that have upgrad both school type of school
p5745
aVnow throw money at the problem is not the answer you will find that some of the worst school system in america get the most money per student
p5746
aVso i believ that we need to reward these good teacher
p5747
aVwe need to encourag program such as teach for america and troop to teacher where peopl after have serv in the militari can go right to teach and not have to take these examin which or have the certif that some are requir in some state
p5748
aVlook we must improv educ in this countri as far as colleg educ is concern we need to make those student loan avail we need to give them a repay schedul that they can meet we need to have full student loan program for in state tuition and we certain need to adjust the certain loan elig to inflat
p5749
aVwell we have a tradit of local control of the school and that s a tradit that has serv us well but i do think that it is import for the feder govern to step up and help local school district do some of the thing they need to do
p5750
aVnow we tri to do this under presid bush he put forward no child left behind unfortun they left the money behind for no child left behind and local school district end up have more of a burden a bunch of unfund mandat the same kind of thing that happen with special educ where we did the right thing by say everi school should provid educ to kid with special need but we never follow through on the promis of fund and that left local school district veri cash strap
p5751
aVso what i want to do is focus on earli childhood educ provid teacher higher salari in exchang for more support sen mccain and i actual agre on two thing that he just mention
p5752
aVcharter school i doubl the number of charter school in illinoi despit some reserv from teacher union i think it s import to foster competit insid the public school
p5753
aVwhat i ve said is i want to provid a tax cut for 95 percent of work american 95 percent if you make more if you make less than a quarter million dollar a year then you will not see your incom tax go up your capit gain tax go up your payrol tax not one dime
p5754
aVand we also agre on the need for make sure that if we have bad teacher that they are swift after given an opportun to prove themselv if they can t hack it then we need to move on becaus our kid have to have their best futur
p5755
aVwhere we disagre is on the idea that we can somehow give out voucher give voucher as a way of secur the problem in our educ system and i also have to disagre on sen mccain s record when it come to colleg access and afford
p5756
aVrecent his key econom advis was ask about whi he didn t seem to have some specif program to help young peopl go to colleg and the respons was well you know we can t give money to everi interest group that come along
p5757
aVi don t think america s youth are interest group i think they re our futur and this is an exampl of where we are go to have to priorit we can t say we re go to do thing and then not explain in concret term how we re go to pay for it
p5758
aVand if we re go to do some of the thing you mention like lower loan rate or what have you somebodi has got to pay for it it s not go to happen on it own
p5759
aVwell sure i m sure you re awar sen obama of the program in the washington d c school system where voucher are provid and there s a certain number i think it s a thousand and some and some 9 000 parent ask to be elig for that
p5760
aVbecaus they want to have the same choic that you and i and cindi and your wife have had and that is becaus they want to choos the school that they thought was best for their children
p5761
aVand we all know the state of the washington d c school system that was voucher that was voucher sen obama and i m frank surpris you didn t pay more attent to that exampl
p5762
aVnow as far as the no child left behind is concern it was a great first begin in my view it had it flaw it had it problem the first time we had look at the issu of educ in america from a nationwid perspect and we need to fix a lot of the problem we need to sit down and reauthor it
p5763
aVand 95 percent of work famili 95 percent of you out there will get a tax cut in fact independ studi have look at our respect plan and have conclud that i provid three time the amount of tax relief to middl class famili than sen mccain doe
p5764
aVbut again spend more money isn t alway the answer i think the head start program is a great program a lot of peopl includ me said look it s not do what it should do by the third grade mani time children who were in the head start program aren t ani better off than the other
p5765
aVlet s reform it let s reform it and fund it that was of cours out of bound by the democrat we need to reform these program we need to have transpar we need to have reward it s a system that cri out for account and transpar and the adequ fund
p5766
aVand i just said to you earlier town hall meet after town hall meet parent come with kid children precious children who have autism sarah palin know about that better than most and we ll find and we ll spend the money research to find the caus of autism and we ll care for these young children and all american will open their wallet and their heart to do so
p5767
aVbut to have a situat as you mention in our earlier comment that the most expens educ in the world is in the unit state of america also mean that it cri out for reform as well
p5768
aVand i will support those reform and i will fund the one that are reform but i m not go to continu to throw money at a problem and i ve got to tell you that voucher where they are request and where they are agre to are a good and workabl system and it s been proven
p5769
aVi ll just make a quick comment about voucher in d c sen mccain s absolut right the d c school system is in terribl shape and it has been for a veri long time and we ve got a wonder new superintend there who s work veri hard with the young mayor there to tri
p5770
aVwho support voucher
p5771
aVwho initi actual support charter
p5772
aVshe support voucher also
p5773
aVbut the but here s the thing is that even if sen mccain were to say that voucher were the way to go i disagre with him on this becaus the data doesn t show that it actual solv the problem the centerpiec of sen mccain s educ polici is to increas the voucher program in d c by 2 000 slot
p5774
aVnow the convers i had with joe the plumber what i essenti said to him was five year ago when you were in a posit to buy your busi you need a tax cut then
p5775
aVthat leav all of you who live in the other 50 state without an educ reform polici from sen mccain
p5776
aVso if we are go to be serious about this issu we ve got to have a presid who is go to tackl it head on and that s what i intend to do as presid
p5777
aVbecaus there s not enough voucher therefor we shouldn t do it even though it s work i got it
p5778
aVwell thank you again bob
p5779
aVthank to hofstra
p5780
aVand it s great to be with you again i think we ve had a veri healthi discuss
p5781
aVand what i want to do is to make sure that the plumber the nurs the firefight the teacher the young entrepreneur who doesn t yet have money i want to give them a tax break now and that requir us to make some import choic
p5782
aVmy friend as i said in my open remark these are veri difficult time and challeng for america and they were graphic demonstr again today
p5783
aVamerica need a new direct we cannot be satisfi with what we ve been do for the last eight year
p5784
aVi have a record of reform and take on my parti the other parti the special interest whether it be an hmo patient bill of right or tri to clean up the campaign financ system in in this countri or whether it be establish of a 9 11 commiss i have a long record of it
p5785
aVand i ve been a care steward of your tax dollar we have to make health care afford and avail we have to make qualiti educ there for all of our citizen not just the privileg few
p5786
aVwe have to stop the spend we have to stop the spend which has mortgag your children s futur
p5787
aVall of these thing and all the promis and commit that sen obama and i made inaud made to you tonight will base will be base on whether you can trust us or not to be care steward of your tax dollar to make sure america is safe and secur and prosper to make sure we reform the institut of govern
p5788
aVthat s whi i ve ask you not onli to examin my record but my propos for the futur of this countri
p5789
aVi ve spent my entir life in the servic of this nation and put my countri first as a long line of mccain that have serv our countri for a long time in war and in peac it s been the great honor of my life and i ve been proud to serv
p5790
aVand i hope you ll give me an opportun to serv again i d be honor and humbl
p5791
aVthe last point i ll make about small busi not onli do 98 percent of small busi make less than 250 000 but i also want to give them addit tax break becaus they are the driver of the economi they produc the most job
p5792
aVwell i want to thank sen mccain and bob for moder
p5793
aVi think we all know america is go through tough time right now the polici of the last eight year and and washington s unwilling to tackl the tough problem for decad has left us in the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress
p5794
aVand that s whi the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same fail polici and the same fail polit that we ve seen over the last eight year and somehow expect a differ result
p5795
aVwe need fundament chang in this countri and that s what i d like to bring
p5796
aVyou know over the last 20 month you ve invit me into your home you ve share your stori with me and you ve confirm onc again the fundament decenc and generos of the american peopl
p5797
aVand that s whi i m sure that our brighter day are still ahead
p5798
aVbut we re go to have to invest in the american peopl again in tax cut for the middl class in health care for all american and colleg for everi young person who want to go in busi that can creat the new energi economi of the futur in polici that will lift wage and will grow our middl class
p5799
aVthese are the polici i have fought for my entir career and these are the polici i want to bring to the white hous
p5800
aVbut it s not go to be easi it s not go to be quick it is go to be requir all of us democrat republican independ to come togeth and to renew a spirit of sacrific and servic and respons
p5801
aVi m absolut convinc we can do it i would ask for your vote and i promis you that if you give me the extraordinari honor of serv as your presid i will work everi singl day tireless on your behalf and on the behalf of the futur of our children
p5802
aVyou know when sen obama end up his convers with joe the plumber we need to spread the wealth around in other word we re go to take joe s money give it to sen obama and let him spread the wealth around
p5803
aVthank you veri much
p5804
aVi want joe the plumber to spread that wealth around you told him you want to spread the wealth around
p5805
aVthe whole premis behind sen obama s plan are class warfar let s spread the wealth around i want small busi and by the way the small busi that we re talk about would receiv an increas in their tax right now
p5806
aVwho whi would you want to increas anybodi s tax right now whi would you want to do that anyon anyon in america when we have such a tough time when these small busi peopl like joe the plumber are go to creat job unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around
p5807
aVi m not go to
p5808
aVok can i
p5809
aVwe re not go to do that in my administr
p5810
aVif i can answer the question number one i want to cut tax for 95 percent of american now it is true that my friend and support warren buffett for exampl could afford to pay a littl more in tax in order
p5811
aVwe re talk about joe the plumber
p5812
aVin order to give in order to give addit tax cut to joe the plumber befor he was at the point where he could make 250 000
p5813
aVthen exxon mobil which made 12 billion record profit over the last sever quarter they can afford to pay a littl more so that ordinari famili who are hurt out there they re tri to figur out how they re go to afford food how they re go to save for their kid colleg educ they need a break
p5814
aVso look nobodi like tax i would prefer that none of us had to pay tax includ myself but ultim we ve got to pay for the core invest that make this economi strong and somebodi s got to do it
p5815
aVnobodi like tax let s not rais anybodi s tax ok
p5816
aVwell i don t mind pay a littl more
p5817
aVthe fact is that busi in america today are pay the second highest tax rate of anywher in the world our tax rate for busi in america is 35 percent ireland it s 11 percent
p5818
aVwhere are compani go to go where they can creat job and where they can do best in busi
p5819
aVwe need to cut the busi tax rate in america we need to encourag busi
p5820
aVnow of all time in america we need to cut peopl s tax we need to encourag busi creat job not spread the wealth around
p5821
aVwell first of all i think it s import for the american public to understand that the 750 billion rescu packag if it s structur proper and as presid i will make sure it s structur proper mean that ultim taxpay get their money back and that s import to understand
p5822
aVbut there is no doubt that we ve been live beyond our mean and we re go to have to make some adjust
p5823
aVnow what i ve done throughout this campaign is to propos a net spend cut i haven t made a promis about
p5824
aVabsolut so let me get to that what i want to emphas though is that i have been a strong propon of pay as you go everi dollar that i ve propos i ve propos an addit cut so that it match
p5825
aVand some of the cut just to give you an exampl we spend 15 billion a year on subsidi to insur compani it doesn t under the medicar plan it doesn t help senior get ani better it s not improv our health care system it s just a giveaway
p5826
aVwe need to elimin a whole host of program that don t work and i want to go through the feder budget line by line page by page program that don t work we should cut program that we need we should make them work better
p5827
aVnow what is true is that sen mccain and i have a differ in term of the need to invest in america and the american peopl i mention health care earlier
p5828
aVif we make invest now so that peopl have coverag that we are prevent diseas that will save on medicar and medicaid in the futur
p5829
aVif we invest in a serious energi polici that will save in the amount of money we re borrow from china to send to saudi arabia
p5830
aVif we invest now in our young peopl and their abil to go to colleg that will allow them to drive this economi into the 21st centuri
p5831
aVbut what is absolut true is that onc we get through this econom crisi and some of the specif propos to get us out of this slump that we re not go to be abl to go back to our proflig way
p5832
aVand we re go to have to embrac a cultur and an ethic of respons all of us corpor the feder govern and individu out there who may be live beyond their mean
p5833
aVwell thank you bob i just want to get back to this home ownership dure the depress era we had a thing call the home ownership loan corpor
p5834
aVand they went out and bought up these mortgag and peopl were abl to stay in their home and eventu the valu of those home went up and they actual made money
p5835
aVand by the way this was a propos made by sen clinton not too long ago
p5836
aVso obvious if we can start increas home valu then there will be creation of wealth
p5837
aVbut ok all right
p5838
aVenergi well first second of all energi independ we have to have nuclear power we have to stop send 700 billion a year to countri that don t like us veri much it s wind tide solar natur gas nuclear off shore drill which sen obama has oppos
p5839
aVand the point is that we becom energi independ and we will creat million of job million of job in america
p5840
aVok what what would i cut i would have first of all across the board spend freez ok some peopl say that s a hatchet that s a hatchet and then i would get out a scalpel ok
p5841
aVbecaus we ve got we have presid over the largest increas we ve got to have a new direct for this countri we have presid over the largest increas in govern sinc the great societi
