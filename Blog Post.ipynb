    "<p>\n",
    "Our Fall 2016 Incubator project sought to identify political party affiliation identification through speech. To accomplish this task we used Presidential candidate debates and the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. NLP is the analysis of language, from plain-spoken english of children to the polished rhetoric of politicans. Using python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) we were able to process political speech for classification purposes with roughly 80% accuracy. Essentially, given a paragraph of text we could estimate with 80% accuracy whether that paragraph leaned left or right on the American political spectrum.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The data most readily available for analysis was from presidential debates made publicly available through the The American Presidency Project (http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php). This data is valuable in several ways: \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li><strong>It is labelled:</strong>We know the candidate who made the response and their party affiliation. If we were to pull data from other venues, such as chatrooms or comment sections, we might infer party affiliation but we wouldn't <em>know</em> unless we asked that person...and even if we did ask we might not know how mainstream (in terms of the party represented) their opinion was.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>It is relatively clean:</strong>These are prepared debates. The website hosting this data has clearly marked the speaker and organized their responses in structured paragraphs using clear HTML conventions. This makes data retrieval easy.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>It can be verified:</strong>These debates were broadcast to millions of individuals. If there is some concern over the quality of our data at a future point in time, any critic can review our data against several independent sources to verify we have it right -- the candidates actually said these words.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "As a final caveat, to account for shifting party lines and tone across time we focused on debates since the year 2000.\n",
    "</p>\n",
