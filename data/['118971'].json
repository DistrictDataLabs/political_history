Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight.

I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.","title":"Presidential Candidates Debates: Presidential Debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York"},"33":{"date":"September 26, 2016","speaker":"CLINTON:","text":"I don't buy that.

They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in\u2014automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement.

We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.","title":"Presidential Candidates Debates: Presidential Debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York"},"50":{"date":"September 26, 2016","speaker":"CLINTON:","text":"In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.
