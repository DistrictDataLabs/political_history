What's wrong with that?","title":"Presidential Candidates Debates: Presidential Debate at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas"},"25":{"date":"October 19, 2016","speaker":"CLINTON:","text":" Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.

And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.

Why?","title":"Presidential Candidates Debates: Presidential Debate at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas"},"54":{"date":"October 19, 2016","speaker":"CLINTON:","text":" Because Roe v.
