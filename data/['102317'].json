My plan has five basic parts: One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America; crack down on China if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world; we are far away from that now. Number four, get us to a balanced budget.

","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"26":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"The President.","text":"So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit.

That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make without dumping those costs onto middle class Americans, I think, is one of the central questions of this campaign.

","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"30":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"Gov. Romney.","text":" Well, sure, I'd like to clear up the record and go through piece by piece. First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax cut of the scale that you're talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They'll do fine whether you're President or I am. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"31":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"Gov. Romney.","text":"The people who are having a hard time right now are middle-income Americans. Under the President's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They're just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax. It's been crushing. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"32":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"Gov. Romney.","text":"At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the President, electric rates are up, food prices are up, health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is, how to get them going again? And I've described it. It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget, and helping small business. Those are the cornerstones of my plan. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"33":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"Gov. Romney.","text":"But the President mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note. First, education. I agree education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them housed in the Federal Government, reporting to 8 different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We've got to get those dollars back to the States and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"34":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"Gov. Romney.","text":"The second area, taxation. We agree we ought to bring the tax rates down, and I do: both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue and have the Government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"35":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"Gov. Romney.","text":"The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the President pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up, but not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on Government land. On Government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"36":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"Gov. Romney.","text":"If I'm President, I'll double them and also get the oil from offshore in Alaska, and I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And by the way, I like coal. I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"37":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"Gov. Romney.","text":"And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the revenues going to the Government. My number-one principle is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden paid\u2014being paid by middle-income Americans. And to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.

","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"40":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"The President.","text":" Well, I think\u2014let's talk about taxes because I think it's instructive. Now, 4 years ago when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle class families, and that's exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle class families by about $3,600. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"41":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"The President.","text":"And the reason is because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who is going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits and then hire more workers. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"42":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"The President.","text":"Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he's been asked over a hundred times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"43":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"The President.","text":"But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim. When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper income individuals can\u2014are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"44":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"The President.","text":"And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit\u2014or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle class families; the average middle class family with children would pay about $2,000 more. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"45":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"The President.","text":"Now, that's not my analysis. That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And that kind of top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making 3 million bucks is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.

Romney.","text":" So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say, absolutely not. I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is, I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's no economist can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.

I know that you and your running mate keep saying that, and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case. Look, I've got five boys. I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it. [","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"55":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"Laughter","text":"And number three, I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you described and say it's completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by 3 to $4,000 on middle-income families. Throw all these studies out there.

I want to bring the rates down, at the same time, lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is, because small business pays that individual rate. Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.

And now, 5 weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is \"never mind.\" And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It's math. It's arithmetic. ","title":"Barack Obama: Presidential Debate in Denver, Colorado"},"63":{"date":"October 3, 2012","speaker":"The President.","text":"Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small business 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates\u2014the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.

And the reason this is important is because, by doing that, we can not only reduce the deficit, we can not only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.

Under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened. But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business.
